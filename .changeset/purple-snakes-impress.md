Enhancements to FE & FF Configurations: The updates include adding the `start-variants-management` script to `package.json` for FE and FF. The OdataService interface now has an `ignoreCertError` property. UI5 application writer introduces the `sapuxLayer` property to `package.json` templates and adds `fiori-tools-preview middleware` to ui5, ui5-mock, and ui5-local.yaml. Additionally, the `addFioriToolsPreviewMiddleware` function has been added for YAML config integration.
