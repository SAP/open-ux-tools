# Example: CLI using the prompts and fe-fpm-writer modules

This project contains scripts to prompt and generate FPM based building blocks.

## Usage
Run the following:
```bash
pnpm start
```

This will prompt a series a questions to capture information required to generate building blocks. The building blocks will be inserted into a new Fiori elements application in the `test-output/fe-app` folder. Look for the view xml file in the `webapp/ext` folder.
