# Example: Simple Yeoman Generator For Fiori Elements
This is a simple example of how to integrate the `@sap-ux/fiori-elements-writer` into a Yeoman generator.

## Example
This example project contains a generator that asks a few simple questions and then using the `@sap-ux/fiori-elemenets-writer` to generate a LROP application for Odata v4. Additionally, it generates a husky config to the project that checks the used dependencies for security issues before each commit.

## Prerequisite
Before you can use the generator, you need to globally install `yo` and build the generator
```
npm install -g yo
pnpm build
```

## Usage
To start the generator execute `pnpm start`.
When prompted, enter the request values e.g.
```
? Application name myapp
? Service url http://test.example.com/my/service/path
? Main entity MyEntity
```

The project will be generated in subfolder of `.tmp`.
