# @sap-ux/fiori-generator-shared

Commonly used shared functionality to support the fiori generator.
Add functionality that may be used by multiple generator modules.

When adding additional templates, ensure the calling function (e.g., generateReadMe) remains at the src directory level to align with the template location pattern used during generator bundling.
