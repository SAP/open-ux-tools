TODO
* This need to be put in a separate package, e.g. mock-server or muab ...
* Code quality needs improvement this `muab` branch is only for the demo.
* Check if .css or any static resources go through the muab if so how can we filter them we do nto want
to clutter the muab.config.

* When we export .har, preserve logs in the checkbox need to be marked otherwise
the .har will contain ...show more for large response bodies being truncated and the .har json will be invalid.
This need to be verified.
