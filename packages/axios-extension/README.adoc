# Axios OData

The `@sap-ux/axios-odata` module is an extension of the [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) framework adding convenience methods to interact with SAP systems especially with OData services..

## Features

### Service Providers
The module offers service provider modules that represent a target system that expose OData services.

#### OData Service Provider
The base service provider extends the class `Axios` abstracting whether it is running in SAP Business Application Studio or locally.
