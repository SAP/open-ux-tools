# Axios Extension

The `@sap-ux/axios-extension` module is an extension of the [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) framework adding convenience methods to interact with SAP systems especially with OData services..

## Features

### Factories
The module offers factory functions allowing to generate `ServiceProvider` instances.

### Service Provider
The base service provider extends the class `Axios` abstracting whether it is running in SAP Business Application Studio or locally.

It offers convenience methods to simplify the handling of:

* different versions of S/4 HANA systems
* different authentication methods in the SAP ecosystem.
* running locally or in SAP Business Application Studio

It exposes the `service(path)` method that creates a new Axios instance for the requested service. It will reuse authentication details and cookies from the provider.

### ABAP Service Provider
Another extension of the base provider handling specifics for ABAP based backend systems. It offers simplified access to the catalog services as well as the UI5 ABAP repository service.

### Services

#### Catalog Service
