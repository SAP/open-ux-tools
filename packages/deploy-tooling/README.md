#  `@sap-ux/deploy-tooling`

`@sap-ux/deploy-tooling` exposes the capabilities of custom tasks to deploy and undeploy SAP Fiori projects against ABAP servers.

### Pre-requisites

- SAP component SAP_UI 7.53 or higher is installed in your SAP system
- Service needs to be enabled and accessible from your development environment, [how to check this](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_NETWEAVER_AS_ABAP_752/68bf513362174d54b58cddec28794093/bb2bfe50645c741ae10000000a423f68.html?version=7.52.5)
- For operations on a SAPUI5 ABAP repository, you need the `S_DEVELOP` authorization, [how to check this](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/91f3ecc06f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070)

## CLI
The module also exposes two commands `deploy` and `undeploy`.

## Install

```bash
`npm install @sap-ux/deploy-tooling --save-dev`
# or
yarn add @sap-ux/deploy-tooling --dev
```

# Verify local installation
```
npx deploy -h
# or
./node_modules/.bin/deploy -h
```

## Usage

```bash
deploy [options]
# or
undeploy [options]
```

By default, YAML configuration is read from `ui5-deploy.yaml`, found in the root of your project when the `deploy` | `undeploy` commands are executed.

To change the default configuration location, run;

Deploy
```bash
deploy -c myproject/my-deploy-config.yaml
# or
deploy --config myproject/my-deploy-config.yaml
```

Undeploy
```bash
undeploy -c myproject/my-undeploy-config.yaml
# or
undeploy --config myproject/my-undeploy-config.yaml
```

#### Minimal Configuration

This is the minimal custom task configuration for deployment using package `$TMP`;
* Supports `Basic Authentication` using environment variables
* Change is recorded in a transport request

```yaml
- name: abap-deploy-task
  configuration:
    app:
      name: Z_TEST
      package: $TMP
    target:
      url: https://target.example
    exclude:
      - /test/
```

#### Additional Configuration Options

##### Credentials
You can provide credentials for the ABAP system using environment variables. The credentials are required for authentication against the ABAP system. Plain text credentials are not supported, use environment variables instead.

```yaml
- name: abap-deploy-task
  configuration:
    credentials:
      username: env:XYZ_USER
      password: env:XYZ_PASSWORD
    app:
      name: Z_TEST
      package: $TMP
    target:
      url: https://target.example
    exclude:
      - /test/
```
Create an `.env` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```
XYZ_USER=your-username
XYZ_PASSWORD=your-password
```

##### Logging
Set the level of detail for log messages, default is `Info`;
```json
Error = 0,
Warn = 1,
Info = 2,
Verbose = 3,
Debug = 4,
Silly = 5
```
Custom task YAML Configuration example:
```yaml
- name: abap-deploy-task
  configuration:
    log: 5
    app:
      name: Z_TEST
      package: $TMP
    target:
      url: https://target.example
    exclude:
      - /test/
```
Or setting `verbose: true` will set the log level to `Silly`:

```yaml
- name: abap-deploy-task
  configuration:
    verbose: true
    app:
      name: Z_TEST
      package: $TMP
    target:
      url: https://target.example
    exclude:
      - /test/
```

### Deploy
The `deploy` command executes the same functionality as the `abap-deploy` UI5 task independent of the `ui5 build` execution. This allows to separate the build and the deployment process e.g. for CI/CD or to provide configurations as CLI args instead of having them defined in the `ui5.yaml` - nevertheless, the `ui5.yaml` is always required as a basis for the configuration.

```
Usage: deploy [options]

Options:
  -c, --config <path-to-yaml>          Path to config yaml file
  -y, --yes                            yes to all questions (default: false)
  -n, --no-retry                       do not retry if deploy fails for any reason, for CI/CD pipeline flows this option needs to be included (default: false)
  --verbose                            verbose log output (default: false)
  --destination  <destination>         Destination in SAP BTP pointing to an ABAP system

  --password                           ABAP Service password, plain text credentials are not supported, use environment variables
  --authentication-type                Authentication type for the app (e.g. 'basic', 'reentranceTicket'). Required for 'reentranceTicket'.

#### Deploy Examples

Example 1 - Deploy to an ABAP Cloud system with strict SSL disabled

```bash
deploy --url <target-abap-system> --cloud true --name <app-name> --description '<app-description>' --package <package-name> --transport <transport-request> --no-strict-ssl
```
Using YAML configuration;
```YAML
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/schema/ui5.yaml.json

specVersion: "3.1"
metadata:
  name: my.namespace.myappname
type: application
builder:
  resources:
    excludes:
      - /test/**
      - /localService/**
  customTasks:
    - name: abap-deploy-task
      afterTask: generateCachebusterInfo
      configuration:        
        target:
          url: <target-abap-system>
          cloud: true
        app:
          name: <app-name>
          description: <app-description>
          package: <package-name>
          transport: <transport-request>
        exclude:
          - /test/
```
Deploy CLI command;
```bash
deploy -c ui5-deploy.yaml --no-strict-ssl
```

### Undeploy
The `undeploy` command allows undeploying a previously deployed application. This functionality is only available as CLI command and not as ui5 task.

```

Options:
  -c, --config <path-to-yaml>          Path to config yaml file
  -y, --yes                            yes to all questions (default: false)
  -n, --no-retry                       do not retry if undeploy fails for any reason, for CI/CD pipeline flows this option needs to be included (default: false)
  --verbose                            verbose log output (default: false)
  --destination  <destination>         Destination in SAP BTP pointing to an ABAP system

  --client <sap-client>                Client number of target ABAP system
  --cloud                              target is an ABAP Cloud system
  --cloud-service-key <file-location>  JSON file location with the ABAP cloud service key.
  --cloud-service-env                  Load ABAP cloud service properties from either a .env file or your environment variables
  --username                           ABAP Service username
  --password                           ABAP Service password
  --authentication-type                Authentication type for the app (e.g. 'basic', 'reentranceTicket'). Required for 'reentranceTicket'.
  --transport <transport-request>      Transport number to record the change in the ABAP system
  --create-transport                   Create a transport request during deployment
  --package <abap-package>             Package name for deploy target ABAP system (only required when --create-transport is used)
  --name <bsp-name>                    Project name of the app
  --no-strict-ssl                      Deactivate SSL certificate validation, enabled by default
  --test                               Run in test mode. ABAP backend reports undeployment errors without actually undeploying (use --no-test to deactivate it).
  -v, --version                        version of the deploy tooling
  -h, --help                           display help for command
```

### Proxy Support

To enable support for TLS (Transport Layer Security) connections when using `HTTPS_PROXY`, update your environment by setting the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable, as shown;

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=<YOUR-PROXY:PORT>
```

In order to support credentials in the proxy URL, you can set the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable to include the username and password in the URL. For example:

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:password@proxy.domain.com:3128
```

Ensure you restart any running processes to apply the changes.

Example Scenario

If you're using a proxy server to route your HTTPS traffic, the proxy server will need to create a secure, TLS-encrypted connection to the target server on your behalf. `tls.connect()` will be used to establish that encrypted tunnel between your client, the proxy, and the server.
