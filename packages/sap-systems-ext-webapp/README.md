# SAP Systems Extension Webapp 


This web application is part of the **SAP Systems Visual Studio Code** extension. It provides the frontend interface that enables users to view, configure, and manage SAP system connections directly within the IDE.

During development, the webapp can be built and served locally for faster iteration and debugging. When packaged, it is bundled under the extensionâ€™s `dist/webapp` directory and loaded automatically at runtime.
