# Connection Manager for SAP Systems (Webapp)


This web application is part of the **Connection Manager for SAP Systems** extension. It provides the front-end interface that enables users to view, configure, and manage SAP system connections directly within the IDE.

During development, the webapp can be built and served locally for faster iteration and debugging. When packaged, it is bundled under the extension’s `dist/webapp` directory and loaded automatically at runtime.
