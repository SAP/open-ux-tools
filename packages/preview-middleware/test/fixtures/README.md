# Test Fixtures

The text fixtures are created to manually test and debug the middleware locally. To use it, just run `npm i` once and then use `npm start`. The start script will trigger a build of the `preview-middleware` beforehand, so that always the latest sources are used.

## simple-app
Very basic example of an application with a flex change that is previewed in a local Fiori launchpad.

## multi-app
More advanced middleware configuration that adds an additional project to the launchpad for testing.
