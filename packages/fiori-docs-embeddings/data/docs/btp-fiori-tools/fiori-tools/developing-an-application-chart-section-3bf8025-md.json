Click the *Object/Form Entry Page* to open the *Page Editor*.\n2.  Navigate to the section node in the outline and click the :heavy_plus_sign: \\(*Add*\\) icon.\n\n    A drop-down menu displaying currently supported section types is displayed.\n\n3.  Select *Add Chart Section* from the drop-down list.\n\n    A pop-up window with following attributes:\n\n    -   *Label*\n    -   *Entity*\n    -   *Type*\n    -   *Dimension*\n    -   *Measure*\n\n    A measure can be specified by selecting one of the following:\n\n    -   Use existing measure\n    -   Create new measure\n\n    If you choose to use existing measure, select one of the available measures defined with custom or transformation aggregations in the *Name* field.\n\n    If you choose to create new measure, choose the aggregable property and one of the supported aggregation methods . This allows you to create a new **dynamic** measure and use it in the chart.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > The technical name and the label are generated automatically. You can then adjust the generated label in the *Property Panel*.\n\n4.  Click *Add*\n\n    As a result, you can see the following changes applied:\n\n    -   A new `UI.Chart` and a new `UI.ReferenceFacet` with an `annotationPath` pointing to the created `UI.Chart` is added to the existing `UI.Facets`.\n    -   If you chose to create a new measure, `@Analytics.AggregatedProperty` is applied to the selected aggregable property with your chosen aggregation method.\n    -   If not yet available, a new `UI.Facets` annotation is created under the entity associated with that *Object Page*.\n    -   If `UI.Facets` exists on an underlying layer, the annotation in the underlying layer is overridden.\n    -   For CAP CDS, a using statement is added to the overridden file if not yet there.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio3bf8025da58d49b0a03713a84cf347c0__section_nvy_xjz_g5b\"/>\n\n## Deleting Chart Section\n\nYou can delete a section that is not required to be displayed in the UI.\n\nTo delete the section in the application, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Navigate to the section node in the outline.\n2.  Click the :wastebasket: \\(*Delete*\\) icon to open the *Delete Confirmation* popup window.\n3.  Click *Delete* to confirm the action.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> This action deletes the generated `UI.ReferenceFacet` from the `UI.Facets` collection.\n> \n> The `UI.Chart` annotation is cleaned up during the cleanup procedure.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio3bf8025da58d49b0a03713a84cf347c0__section_rdb_prj_35b\"/>\n\n## Maintaining Chart Section Properties\n\nYou can update the properties of the chart and define optional properties in the *Property Panel*. For the information on changing the section label, see [Change Form Section Label](form-section-4102b3d.md#loio4102b3d63d9047c881108e6f0caae15e__changeformsectionlabel).\n\nFor the information on maintaining other chart properties, see [Maintain Analytical Chart Properties](analytical-chart-9c086ec.md#loio9c086ecaace540be83b0e50101244e78__analyticalchartproperties).\n\n\n\n### Hidden\n\nFor more information see, [Hidden](appendix-457f2e9.md#loiof7ad71792a0044d6b6172f078827bdc0).\n\n",
