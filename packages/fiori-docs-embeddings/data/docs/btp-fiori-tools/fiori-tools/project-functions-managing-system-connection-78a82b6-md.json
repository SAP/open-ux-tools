This functionality provides faster authentication when creating an application, generating a deployment configuration, and deploying an application. The credentials are saved in the operating system secured storage, such as Credential Manager in Windows and Keychain in Mac.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio78a82b6852ce4061ba0825afdb79cda6__section_jv1_xgh_3qb\"/>\n\n## View SAP System Details\n\nTo view the details of an existing SAP system, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  On the activity toolbar from the left side, click *SAP Fiori* \\(![Wrench/Pencil icon](../Getting-Started-with-SAP-Fiori-Tools/images/SAP_Fiori_tools_Wrench_Pencil_9d6b0f8.png)\\).\n2.  Expand the *SAP Systems* view.\n\n    You can see the list of saved systems along with the usernames used for authentication.\n\n3.
