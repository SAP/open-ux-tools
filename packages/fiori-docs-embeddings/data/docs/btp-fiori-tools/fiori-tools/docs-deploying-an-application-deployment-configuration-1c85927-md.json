Using the `dotenv` module, the task also supports project-specific environment variables defined in the `.env` file in the root of your project. Use the pattern `env:VAR_NAME` to reference an environment variable.\n\n\n\n### target\n\nThe target object contains properties identifying your target SAP system.\n\n**url**\n\n-   `<string> pattern <protocol>://<hostname>[:<port>]` **\\(Required\\)**\n-   This parameter must contain a URL pointing to your target SAP system.\n\n**client**\n\n-   `<number> range [0..999]` **\\(Optional\\)**\n-   The client property is used to identify the SAP client that is to be used in the backend system. It translates to the url parameter`sap-client=<client>`. If the client parameter is not provided, the default client is used.\n\n**params \\(Optional\\)**\n\n-   `<string>` \\(optional\\)\n-   Specify addtional query parameters to pass to the back end deployment `API`. It translates to the URL parameter such as `sap-language=<2-digit sap language code>`. If the parameter is not provided, the back end/user default is used.\n\n**scp**\n\n-   `<boolean>` \\(default: `false`\\)\n-   By default, the deployment task uses basic authentication when connecting to the back end. If the target system is ABAP Environment on SAP Business Technology Platform, this parameter needs to be set to `true`.\n\n**service**\n\n-   `<string>` \\(default: `/sap/opu/odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV`\\)\n-   Path pointing to the SAPUI5ABAP repository OData service in your target system. This parameter only needs to be used if the service is exposed at a different path in your back-end system. For example, using alias.\n\n\n\n### credentials \\(optional\\)\n\nThe credentials object is required for `CI/CD` based deployments and it needs to contain the required parameters to authenticate at your target system. We strongly encourage not to add the credentials directly but use references to environment variables. For example: `env:MY_VARIABLE` here.\n\nFor local usage \\(not in SAP Business Application Studio\\), we do not recommend using credential objects. As a result, the deployment task utilizes the operating systems' secure storage to maintain credentials.\n\n**username**\n\n-   `<string>` **\\(Required\\)**\n-   SAP business user for the target system. The user requires authorizations to create/update the target ABAP development object.\n\n**password**\n\n-   `<string>` **\\(Required\\)**\n-   Password required to authenticate the previously configured user. **IMPORTANT**: while technically possible to add the password to your configuration, we strongly **DISCOURAGE** that but recommend instead the use of environment variables.\n\n\n\n### app\n\nThe app object describes the back-end object that is created/updated as result of the deployment.\n\n**name**\n\n-   `<string>` **\\(Required\\)**\n-   Unique name of the application. The name is used as a part of the application URL as well as the name of the ABAP development object used as container for the app.\n\n**package**\n\n-   `<string>` **\\(Required for new apps\\)**\n-   Name of an existing ABAP package that is used as parent of the deployed application. The parameter is required for the creation of the application in the back end. Any following deployment updating the application does not require the package parameter is ignored .\n\n**transport**\n\n-   `<string>` **\\(Optional\\)**\n-   The transport parameter refers to a transport request number that is used to record changes to the back end application object. The property is optional as it is only needed if the package for deployments requires transport requests.\n\n**description**\n\n-   `<string>` **\\(Optional\\)**\n-   Optional description added to the created application object in the back end.\n\n**exclude**\n\n-   `<string[] array of regex>` **\\(Optional\\)**\n-   By default, the deployment task creates an archive \\(`.zip` file\\) of all build files and sends it to the backend. By using exclude, you can define expressions to match files that shall not be included into the deployment.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > `string.match()` is used to evaluate the expressions.\n\n\n**index**\n\n-   `true|false` **\\(Default: `false`\\)**\n-   If set to `true`, then an additional `index.html` file is generated and deployed to run the application standalone.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Location of the MTA Directory\n\nThe tool finds the nearest parent directory that contains `mta.yaml` file and offers that as the MTA directory. Failing that, it defaults to the parent directory of the application.\n\n\n\n### Destination\n\nDestination configured to connect to the backend on Cloud Foundry. If there's a setting in the `ui5.yaml` file, that value is offered as the default.\n\n\n\n### Prefix\n\nPrefix is used for the ID of the MTA and the service names. It defaults to the namespace of the app. If a namespace is not found, it defaults to `test`. Select a prefix so that the service names are unique to your MTA. Otherwise, deployment by multiple people will overwrite the same service. At the end of the generation, it is possible to optionally generate a SAP Fiori launchpad configuration \\(default: no\\).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio1c859274b511435ab6bd45f70e7f9af2__section_bxq_gp3_k4b\"/>\n\n## \\(Optional\\): Setting environment variables in an .env file\n\nIf you prefer to keep the environment variables in a file, you can create the `.env` file at the root of your project that contains the environment variables to be referenced in the `ui5-deploy.yaml` file.\n\nWe recommend that you do not have your actual username and password in the`ui5-deploy.yaml`. In this case, you will be asked to provide these credentials during deployment if needed.\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ```\n> XYZ_USER=[MY_USER_NAME]\n> XYZ_PASSWORD=[MY_PASSWORD]\n> ```\n\n",
