Launch the Project Accelerator using SAP Fiori tools AI through one of the following options:\n\n    1.  Command Palette\n\n        Open the Command Palette \\([CMD/CTRL\\] + [Shift\\] + [P\\] \\) and execute the `Fiori tools AI: Launch the Project Accelerator` command.\n\n    2.  SAP Fiori\n\n        Click the <span class=\"SAP-icons-TNT-V3\"></span> \\(*SAP Fiori*\\) icon on the activity bar.\n\n    3.  Joule\n\n        Click the <span class=\"SAP-icons-TNT-V3\"></span> \\(*Joule*\\) icon on the activity bar.\n\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > Once you’ve opened the Project Accelerator in SAP Fiori tools AI, your query must be related to generating an SAP Fiori elements application. You cannot make general requests to the AI assistant.\n\n2.  Depending on the method you used to launch SAP Fiori tools AI, enter your business requirements as follows:\n\n    -   Text input:\n        -   Command Palette and SAP Fiori: Under *Project Accelerator*, enter your business requirements in the *Application requirements* textbox.\n        -   Joule: Enter `/fiori-gen-spec-app #(path to your docx, markdown, or text file)` and click the *Send* icon.\n\n    -   File input:\n        -   Upload the file to your workspace folder in SAP Business Application Studio.\n        -   Command Palette and SAP Fiori: Under *Project Accelerator*, click *Choose File \\(docx, .md, .txt, .jpg\\)* and choose your markdown, text, or docx file.\n        -   Joule: Enter the `/fiori-gen-spec-app` command followed by your business requirements and click the *Send* icon.\n\n\n    For the best results, use English and follow the provided examples:\n\n    -   [Example 1: Manage Contracts and Customer Information in the System](example-1-manage-contracts-and-customer-information-in-the-system-c1bccf2.md)\n\n    -   [Example 2: Display Customers with Related Contracts](example-2-display-customers-with-related-contracts-a6c978f.md)\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > The Project Accelerator cannot generate a second application for the same project, so ensure your request only refers to a single application.\n\n3.  Provide the *Project Folder Path* that you want to generate the project into.\n4.  Click *Generate*.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > If you launch SAP Fiori tools AI using Joule, you are transferred to the Project Accelerator to generate your application.\n\n    Depending on your business requirements, generation may take some time.\n\n    You can stop the generation if you want to cancel the process and make further changes. To stop the generation, click the :white_large_square: \\(*Stop*\\) icon. Then, click *Yes* at the *Are you sure you want to stop generation?* prompt. The process is stopped. You can then edit your business requirements and generate a new application.\n\n5.  The generated project is added to your filesystem at the project folder path you chose. Then, *Application Information* is launched for the associated SAP Fiori application. You can then make further changes using SAP Fiori tools.\n\n\n",
