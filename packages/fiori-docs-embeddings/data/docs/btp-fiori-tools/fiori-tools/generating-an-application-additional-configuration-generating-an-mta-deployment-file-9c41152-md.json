To do so, open the Command Palette \\([CMD/CTRL\\] + [Shift\\] + [P\\] \\) and execute the `Fiori: Open CF Application Router Generator` command.\n\n![](images/Application_Router_Generator_c4b6125.png)\n\nThe user can manage the source code of the app router configuration and multiple SAP Fiori elements projects under a single root directory.\n\nThe app router configuration project has the following structure:\n\n-   `router` - The folder that contains the app router configuration.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > This folder can have a different name, such as `configurable`.\n\n-   `.gitignore` - The file that contains the list of files to be ignored by source control.\n-   `mta.yaml` - The file that contains the MTA configuration.\n-   `package-lock.json` - The file is generated automatically for any operations where npm modifies either the `node_modules` tree or `package.json` file and describes the exact tree that was generated.\n-   `package.json` - The file that contains specifics of `npm package.json`.\n\nOnce the app router configuration project is generated, one or more SAP Fiori apps can be generated inside its root directory by using the SAP Fiori application generator.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> There are the following router types: managed, Application Frontend service, and standalone.
