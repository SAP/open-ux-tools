For that, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Expand the required section and navigate your pointer to the *Fields* node.\n\n2.  Click the :heavy_plus_sign: \\(*Add*\\) icon and click *Add Connected Fields*.\n\n3.  In the *Add Connected Fields* popup window, set the common label. Then choose two semantically related properties as *Field 1* and *Field 2*.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > If the field is already used as part of another connected fields node in the section, you cannot choose it when adding a new one.\n\n4.  You can optionally set the delimiter to be displayed between the field values.\n\n5.  Click *Add* to add connected fields to the *Form section*.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> You cannot add the property that is already used in another connected fields node of the section.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio5d85951736f84ee19ffb2abedbc739f2__section_pt4_jx4_tyb\"/>\n\n## Moving Connected Fields\n\nYou can move the connected fields node within a section or to a different section in the content area and swap the sequence of the fields within the connected fields node. For that, use one of the following functionalities:\n\n**Drag and drop**\n\n-   Drag the connected fields node and place it in a different position within its section or in a different section within the content area once the field is highlighted in green. Use the [Ctrl\\] + [Click\\] combination to select the connected fields node along with other fields for moving.\n\n-   Drag the field in the connected fields node and place it above or below the other field within the node once the field is highlighted in green.\n\n\n**Arrow buttons**\n\n-   Use the <span class=\"SAP-icons-V5\"></span> \\(*Move Up*\\) or <span class=\"SAP-icons-V5\"></span> \\(*Move Down*\\) icons next to the connected fields label to move the connected fields either within its section or to the different section in the content area.\n\n-   Use the <span class=\"SAP-icons-V5\"></span> \\(*Move Up*\\) or <span class=\"SAP-icons-V5\"></span> \\(*Move Down*\\) icons next to the field within the connected fields node to swap the sequence of the connected fields within the node.\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> You cannot move connected fields to the [Header Section](header-a05d7fc.md#loio8a127fc36f5640abaab0056e632fe630).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio5d85951736f84ee19ffb2abedbc739f2__section_qtf_th5_tyb\"/>\n\n## Deleting Connected Fields\n\nYou can delete the connected fields node along with its subnodes, whereas deleting the individual fields within it isn’t possible.\n\nTo delete the connected fields node, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Expand the required section and navigate your pointer to the connected fields node.\n\n2.  Click the :wastebasket: \\(*Delete*\\) icon to open the *Delete Confirmation* popup window.\n\n3.  Click *Delete* to confirm the action.\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> During deletion of the field, `UI.DataField` record is removed from the `UI.FieldGroup` or `UI.Identification` annotation. The annotations applied to the entity properties are not deleted.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> To clean up the orphaned `UI.ConnectedFields` annotation, you need to explicitly run the cleanup procedure that deletes the unreferenced annotations.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio5d85951736f84ee19ffb2abedbc739f2__section_xyx_vj5_tyb\"/>\n\n## Maintaining Connected Field Properties\n\nYou can update the connected fields label and delimiter as well as set the complete connected fields node as hidden.\n\n**Label**\n\nThe label for connected fields is maintained the same as the label for the basic fields. For more information, see [Fields](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/457f2e9699b5437fb09d56311055a4a0.html#fields).\n\n**Delimiter**\n\nYou can choose one or multiple text characters such as `:`, `/`, or `-` to be displayed between the connected fields. If the delimiter is not set, the fields will be separated by space.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The delimiter value is not translatable.\n\n**Hidden**\n\nSimilar to the basic fields, connected fields nodes can be set hidden either statically with the boolean value or dynamically based on the boolean property.\n\nFor more information, see [Hidden](appendix-457f2e9.md#loiof7ad71792a0044d6b6172f078827bdc0).\n\nYou cannot change the properties used as connected fields. If you need to do so, delete the complete connected fields node [Deleting Connected Fields](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/5d85951736f84ee19ffb2abedbc739f2.html#deleting-connected-fields) and add it again with different properties [Adding Connected Fields](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/5d85951736f84ee19ffb2abedbc739f2.html#adding-connected-fields).\n\nYou can set all the basic field properties other than **Label** and **Hidden** on the individual fields level.\n\n**Hide by Property**\n\nOnce you’ve activated the *Hidden* feature with the toggle button, the *Hide by Property* field is displayed right after it to let you set the condition for hiding.\n\nFor more information, see [Hide by Property](appendix-457f2e9.md#loio4e8bb3df433546f8a80f16e53b29e4c1).\n\nFor more information, see [Maintaining Basic Field Properties](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/bdf9573a206b492382cc747e731cf34b/2953503145dd428194c6dff252744ac1.html?state=DRAFT&version=DEV&q=label#maintaining-basic-field-properties).\n\n",
