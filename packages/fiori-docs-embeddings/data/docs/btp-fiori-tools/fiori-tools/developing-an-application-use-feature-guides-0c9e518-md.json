You can read through the steps required to implement a feature and then use the guided development approach to make the required changes in your project.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio0c9e518ecf704b2f80a2bed0eaca60ae__section_g4l_234_slb\"/>\n\n## Launching Guided Development\n\nYou can launch guided development in the following ways:\n\n\n\n### Using the Command Palette\n\n-   Open the *Command Palette* \\([CMD/CTRL\\] + [Shift\\] + [P\\] \\).\n-   Start typing *guided development*.\n-   Click `Fiori: Open Guided Development` or `Fiori: Open Guided Development to the Side`.\n-   Select your SAP Fiori elements project from your workspace.\n\nThe `Fiori: Open Guided Development` option opens guided development in a new tab and in the selected editor region in case the editor is split into multiple regions. The `Fiori: Open Guided Development to the Side` option opens guided development to the side of the current file in another column.\n\n\n\n### Using the Folder Context Menu\n\nIf you already have an SAP Fiori elements project in your current workspace, you can right-click its folder and select *SAP Fiori tools - Open Guided Development*. Then, guided development opens to the side of the current file in another column.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If you do not have any SAP Fiori elements project in your workspace, you can still open guided development by using the *Command Palette*. You can check the available guides descriptions and code samples but the interactive features are disabled.\n\n\n\n### Working with Projects\n\nGuided development can only work with one project at a time. The name of this project is displayed on the tab header next to guided development, and this project provides all project-specific data used in the guides.\n\nThe project-specific data contains the following components:\n\n-   The list of entities in the *Entity* list.\n\n-   The list of data sources in the *Model* list.\n\n-   The list of pages in the *Page* list.\n\n-   The annotation terms that are defined in the service across all the guides.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > In guided development, you can add annotations from services other than the `mainService`.\n\n\nTo select or change a project, proceed as follows:\n\n1.  Click *Select Project* on the left side of the toolbar.\n2.  Select a project from the *Project* list.\n\n    ![Select Project](images/SelectProject_9ea63e4.png)\n\n\nWe recommend that you refresh **guided development** in the cases given in the following table:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nWhen\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nHow\n\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nWhen a new project is added to the workspace.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nClick the <span class=\"SAP-icons-V5\"></span> \\(*Refresh*\\) icon inside the Project list.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nWhen something in the current project is changed outside guided development, such as a new page is added, or an underlying service is updated.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nClick the <span class=\"SAP-icons-V5\"></span> \\(*Refresh*\\) icon on the toolbar next to the Project list.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio0c9e518ecf704b2f80a2bed0eaca60ae__section_lc1_hwm_1rb\"/>\n\n## Accessibility\n\nYou can navigate to guided development with either a mouse or a keyboard. Keyboard navigation provides a streamlined experience, allowing users to find and use guides without needing to use their mouse. Use the arrow keys to navigate within sections, the `Tab` key to navigate to new sections and controls, `Shift + Tab` to navigate back to sections and controls, and `Enter` to make selections.\n\nGuided development supports the use of high contrast themes.\n\n",
