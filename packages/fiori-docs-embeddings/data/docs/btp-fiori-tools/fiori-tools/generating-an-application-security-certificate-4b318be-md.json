You can choose to ignore the error and continue generation with the invalid certificate but this is not recommended.\n\n> ### Tip:  \n> Please ensure you have Node.js installed locally. For more information, see [Visual Studio Code](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/17efa217f7f34a9eba53d7b209ca4280.html).\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The instructions below are applicable when the security certificate is valid, but it is using a local certificate authority that is unknown to the operating system.\n> \n> If the SSL certificate is invalid such as an expired certificate, wrong host, or unable to verify the leaf signature, you can use the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` environment variable to ignore the error. However, it is recommended that the SSL certificate error is resolved rather than ignoring the error.\n\n1.  Ensure that you have a copy of the local certificate authority saved locally.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > Create or select a folder to store your downloaded certificate. To export the certificate from your browser, follow the instructions based on your web browser.\n\n2.  Once the certificate file is downloaded, the issue can be resolved for VS Code by importing it into your global certificate store. To do so, perform the following steps:\n    -   Microsoft Windows\n\n        -   Right-click the *CA certificate* file and select *Install Certificate*.\n\n        -   Follow the prompts to add the certificate to the trust store either for the current user or for all users.\n\n    -   macOS.\n        -   Right-click the *CA certificate* file.\n\n        -   Select *Open With* and naviagte to *Keychain Access*.\n\n        -   Select *System* as the keychain to import into.\n\n\n3.  To resolve the issue for using the command line with Yeoman, set the following environment variable to point to the location of the downloaded certificate file: `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`\n    -   Microsoft Windows:\n\n        -   Right-click the :desktop_computer: \\(*Computer*\\) icon and select *Properties*. Alternatively, in Windows Control Panel, select *System*.\n            -   Microsoft Windows 10\n                -   Right-click*Windows Start Button* and select *System*.\n                -   In *System Settings* under *Related Settings*, select *System info*.\n\n\n            -   Select *Advanced system settings*.\n            -   On the Advanced tab, select *Environment Variables*.\n            -   Click *New* to create a new environment variable.\n            -   Add `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` and ensure the value points to the downloaded certificate file that is stored in the folder from **Step 1**.\n            -   Click *Apply* and then *OK* for the changes to take effect.\n\n\n        macOS\n\n        -   In the command-line terminal, before executing the Yeoman command to run the generators, execute the following command:\n\n            `export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=path/to/certificate/file`\n\n            Replace `path/to/certificate/file` with the location of the downloaded certificate.\n\n\n\n\n",
