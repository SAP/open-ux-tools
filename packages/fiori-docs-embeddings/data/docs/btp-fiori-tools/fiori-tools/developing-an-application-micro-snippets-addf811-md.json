For more information, see [Documentation \\(Quick Info\\)](documentation-quick-info-8728bd7.md) feature.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > XML Annotation LSP provides micro-snippets for annotation targets, terms, records and property values.\n\n\nMicro-snippets are the fastest way to define annotations and together with the word based completion for annotation or metadata elements it eliminates a need to type in the code, thus speeding up the process and helping you to avoid typos or semantical errors.\n\nFor annotation records, two types of micro-snippets are provided for each option: one containing only mandatory properties defined in the respected vocabulary as *nullable=false* and one containing all properties defined for this record.\n\nUsually you need to add just a subset of **properties** to the record, you can either select a full record and then remove the **properties** you do not need, or add the record containing only required properties and then add the remaining properties one by one or all together.\n\n",
