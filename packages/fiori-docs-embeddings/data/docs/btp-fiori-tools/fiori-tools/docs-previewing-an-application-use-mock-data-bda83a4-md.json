For more information, see [Installing MockServer](installing-mockserver-2538055.md).\n\nStart the application using `npm run start-mock`. The application runs on `localhost:8080` but uses a mock server to reflect the OData endpoint. This way, you can use the application without having to connect to a live OData service and generate mock data on the fly. If you want to generate `.json` files for your mock data, see: [Data Editor](../Project-Functions/data-editor-18e43b5.md). The preview of the application opens automatically in a new browser tab.\n\n1.  In Visual Studio Code \\(VS Code\\), open the terminal.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > To open the terminal in VS Code,you can:\n    > \n    > -   Use the [CTRL\\] + [\\`\\]  keyboard shortcut with the backtick character.\n    > -   Select *View* \\> *Terminal* in the menu.\n    > -   Execute the `View: Toggle Integrate Terminal` command from the *Command Palette* \\([CMD/CTRL\\] + [Shift\\] + [P\\] \\) .\n\n2.
