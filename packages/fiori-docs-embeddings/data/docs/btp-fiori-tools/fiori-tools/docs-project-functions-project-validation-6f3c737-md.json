Use a quick pick selection to select a project for validation from the multiple projects in the workspace.\n\nThe validation comprises of the following steps:\n\n-   **project**\n\n    The project step checks that files such as `package.json`, `manifest.json`, and `ui5.yaml` exist and their mandatory fields are filled.\n\n-   **annotation**\n\n    The annotation step validates the project annotation files using the same modules as the XML annotation language server extension.\n\n-   **specification**\n\n    The specification step validates `manifest.json` and files in the changes folder. The `@sap/ux-specification` module is used to import the project and provide invalid configuration error messages.\n\n-   **`eslint`**\n\n    The `eslint` step checks if `eslint` is installed as a dependency. If it is, the project validation runs the `eslint` check based on the project's configuration and the rules defined in the <code><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-fiori-custom\">eslint-plugin-fiori-custom</a></code>. You can enable `eslint` support for a new project by selecting the appropriate options in the *Advanced Options* of the SAP Fiori application generator, as described in the [Additional Configuration](../Generating-an-Application/Additional-Configuration/additional-configuration-9bea64e.md) section.\n\n\nAfter all validation steps are executed, a report is generated and displayed as a Markdown \\(`.md`\\) file and in the *Problems* tab of Visual Studio Code \\(VS Code\\) or SAP Business Application Studio.\n\n",
