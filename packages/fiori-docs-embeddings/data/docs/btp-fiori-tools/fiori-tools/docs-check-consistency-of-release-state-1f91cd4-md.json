The release state of the app is also indicated in the app's `manifest.json` file, under `sap.fiori/cloudDevAdaptationStatus`.\n\nThe ATC check, *SAPUI5 Component Consistency* \\(`CI_UI5_COMP`\\) verifies the consistency of the release state. The following checks are performed:\n\n-   Verify that the `sap.fiori/cloudDevAdaptationStatus` of the UI5 app in the SAPUI5 ABAP repository \\(based on the BSP repository\\) is the same as in the back-end system. This is relevant due to issues during the deployment or due to manual adjustments of the `manifest.json` file.\n\n-   Verify the consistency of release states of the UI5 app and the services it uses \\(C0 and C1 contracts\\).\n\n\nThe ATC check, `CI_UI5_COMP` also performs some other checks. For more information, see [ATC Check SAPUI5 Component Consistency](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/a71400bc82284449bb6c680a4516cc63).\n\nFor more information, see the following documentation:\n\n-   [Extend \\(C0\\)](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/25cf71e63940453397a32dc2b7676947/2ce344a782d74d8aab073fa188af5116.html) contract\n\n-   [Use System-Internally \\(C1\\)](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/25cf71e63940453397a32dc2b7676947/3ccb57a1a4d04ee192fdc2a849a89158.html) contract\n\n-   [Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries \\(manifest.json\\)](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da)\n\n-   [Develop an SAP Fiori Application UI and Deploy it to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Using SAP Business Application Studio](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/6aa39f1ac05441e5a23f484f31e477e7/2a4ae231df8843379df7a36fa3462d4c.html)\n\n\n",
