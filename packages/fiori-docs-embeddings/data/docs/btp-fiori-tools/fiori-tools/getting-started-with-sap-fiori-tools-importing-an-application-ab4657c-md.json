We recommend that you only use this import procedure if the application code is not already available under source control.\n> \n> The `-dbg.js` file, such as `(Component-dbg.js)`, contains the original un-minified code. You can copy its contents into the corresponding `.js` file, for example, *Component-dbg.js* \\> *Component.js* for more human readable code.\n> \n> Remove `-dbg.js`, `-preload.js` and `.js.map` before running UI5 CLI build, otherwise they are recreated in the `dist` folder.\n\nTo import SAP Fiori apps from the SAPUI5 ABAP repository, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Login to your SAPUI5 ABAP back-end system and navigate to the transaction `SE80`.\n2.  Run the report `/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD`.\n3.  Provide the name of the SAPUI5 application and click *Download*.\n4.  Choose an empty folder for the download target.\n5.  From the resulting view, download the files as a `.zip` file using the button *Click here to Download* at the end of the page.\n6.  Extract the `.zip` file into the folder `restore-from-exported/webapp`.\n    -   Verify that the `manifest.json` is located at `restore-from-exported/webapp/manifest.json`.\n\n7.  Create a `package.json` in the folder `restore-from-exported`. The `name` value should match the application name in `manifest.json`.\n\n    ```\n    {\n       \"name\": \"sap.fe.demo.awesomeapp\",\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can see the original application name and namespace in the `manifest.json` file. For example:\n\n    ```\n    {\n       \"sap.app\": {\n          \"id\": \"sap.fe.demo.awesomeapp\",\n          ..\n    }\n    ```\n\n8.  In SAP Business Application Studio or VS Code workspace, start the migration command `Fiori: Migrate Project for use in Fiori tools` if not already prompted to do so.\n9.  The project should be found in `restore-from-exported` and listed for migration.\n10. Choose the appropriate options and migrate the project.\n11. The project is now compatible with SAP Fiori tools.\n\n",
