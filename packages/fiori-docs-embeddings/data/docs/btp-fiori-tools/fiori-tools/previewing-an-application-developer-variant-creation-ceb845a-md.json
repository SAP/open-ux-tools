The variants are stored as SAPUI5 flexibility changes in the project's `webapp/changes` folder and packaged with the application during the build step.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Variants store view settings, such as filter settings or control parameters. On the UI, these variants are referred to as views.\n\nThe feature is delivered with the `@sap/ux-ui5-tooling` node module and its preview feature. Developer variant creation is supported from the SAPUI5 version 1.90 \\(OData V2 based applications\\) and 1.84 \\(OData V4 based applications\\). `@sap/ux-ui5-tooling` only supports ABAP service-based projects.\n\nTo create development variants for your Fiori project with SAP Fiori tools perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Execute `start-variants-management` from the *Preview Application* context menu.\n\n    If the script is not present, configure the feature:\n\n    -   Open the *Command Palette* \\([CMD/CTRL\\] + [Shift\\] + [P\\] \\).\n    -   Execute the `Fiori: Add Configuration for Variants Creation` command.\n\n2.  After the script is executed, a new browser tab appears. It displays the preview of the application switched to the UI adaptation mode.\n3.  For more information on creating developer variants, see [Creating and Adapting Views](https://help.sap.com/viewer/DRAFT/6583b46f6c164aad818a3891bc91d8d8/dev_internal/en-US/91ae3492323b42a79ca66fbfaf5af3f9.html).\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > Visibility and role assignment are not supported for developer variants.\n\n4.  Click *Save & Exit* to save the changes.\n5.  For each new variant, one or multiple SAPUI5 change files are created in the `webapp/changes` folder of your project. You can open each file and replace static texts of your application with translatable text, such as `{i18n>textKey}` and maintain the text in the corresponding `i18n` file of your project.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> For more technical information, see [`@sap/ux-ui5-tooling`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling#4-preview).\n\n",
