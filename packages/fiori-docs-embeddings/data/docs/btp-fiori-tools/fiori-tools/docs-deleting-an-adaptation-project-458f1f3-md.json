Right-click on the main folder, the `webapp` folder, or the `manifest.appdescr_variant` file and click *Open Deployment Wizard*.\n\n2.  Choose the system you want to undeploy the project from. The system you have used to create the project will be selected by default. Click *Next* to continue.\n\n3.  Click *Undeploy* and click *Finish* to start the undeployment.\n\n\n<a name=\"task_ecy_r3p_wtb\"/>\n\n<!-- task\\_ecy\\_r3p\\_wtb -->\n\n## Using ABAP report\n\n\n\n<a name=\"task_ecy_r3p_wtb__prereq_elw_kf3_3vb\"/>\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou have deployed an app variant, which you created using an adaptation project, to your ABAP system.\n\n–¢he minimum required version of the software component is `SAP_UI 7.55`.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"task_ecy_r3p_wtb__steps_ak2_z3p_wtb\"/>\n\n## Procedure\n\n1.  In your project folder, open the `manifest.appdescr_variant` file in your adaptation project and copy the value of the `id` element.\n\n2.  In the back-end system, start transaction `SE38` and execute report `/UI5/DEL_ADAPTATION_PROJECT`.\n\n3.  Paste the copied `ID` of the app variant that you want to delete or use the [F4\\] help to find it.\n\n4.  Click *Execute* \\([F8\\]\\).\n\n5.  If prompted, select or create a transport request.\n\n6.  In the overview of the files that will be deleted, click *Execute* \\([Shift\\] + [F1\\]  \\) again.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"task_ecy_r3p_wtb__result_pkn_srb_fdc\"/>\n\n## Results\n\nThe app variant is deleted from all systems as soon as you release the transport request.\n\n",
