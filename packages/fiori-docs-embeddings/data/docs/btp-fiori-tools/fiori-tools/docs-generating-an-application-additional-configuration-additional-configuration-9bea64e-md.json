Select *Yes* if you want to configure deployment settings.\n2.  From the *Choose the target* dropdown list, select the deploy target from the following options:\n    -   ABAP\n    -   Cloud Foundry\n\n\nWhen the target system is selected, the *Deploy Configuration* SAP Fiori launchpad wizard appears with the following prompts:\n\n\n\n### ABAP system\n\n-   *Destination name* \\(required\\). The ABAP destination to the back-end system.\n-   *Is this an SAP Cloud Platform system?*\n\n    Select *Yes* or *No*. Applicable only if the system to be discovered is a Steampunk system.\n\n-   *Target System URL*. This field has already been prefilled according to the selected project.\n\n    Not applicable in SAP Business Application Studio.\n\n-   *Client*. A self-contained commercial, organizational, and technical unit within an SAP system. Business data of clients are separated from each other, and clients serve a specific purpose in an SAP instance.\n\n    Not applicable to a Steampunk system and in an SAP Business Application Studio.\n\n    The following options are available to select from:\n\n    -   Use project defined client - xxx\n    -   Enter client\n    -   Use default system client\n\n-   *Is this an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system?* Select *Yes* or *No*. Not applicable if the user responds *Yes* to *Is this an SAP Cloud Platform system?*.\n-   *SAPUI5 ABAP Repository* \\(required\\). The technical name of the SAP Fiori application being deployed.\n-   *Package*. A transportable ABAP repository object that groups development objects. An SAP Fiori application deployed in the ABAP backend must be assigned to an appropriate package. If it’s supposed to be a local application that isn't sent to another system, the package can be $TMP. In this case, there’s no Transport Request. Not applicable for SAP S/4HANA Cloud.\n-   *Fetch Transport Request list from target system?*. Select *Yes* or *No*. If you select *Yes*, the applicable list of transport requests is retrieved from the target system and displayed in a dropdown for you to choose. If the lists of transport requests are unable to be retrieved from the target system, the existing manual text entry will be required.\n-   *Transport Request number*. The ID of a container that is used to transfer data from one SAP installation to another. It collects changes made in a development system, allowing distribution of them across the defined transport landscape.\n\n    Not applicable for SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. For more information on transport requests, see [Managing Transport Requests](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8b923a2175be4939816f0981b73856c7/7.2.12/en-US/60264ffa451548f9857f46423afdd1f1.html).\n\n\n\n\n### Cloud Foundry system\n\n-   *Destination name* \\(required\\). The Cloud Foundry destination to the back-end system.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio9bea64e63b824261932d90037ce3c5ae__section_hbd_gzy_t4b\"/>\n\n## Add FLP Configuration\n\nSelect *Yes* if you want to add an SAP Fiori launchpad configuration. A new step appears with the *FLP Configuration* prompts.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If the configuration already exists, the existing values are displayed. In this case, the user still can change the inputs.\n\n-   *Semantic Object*. Represents a business entity, such as a customer, a sales order, or a product. Using semantic objects, the user can bundle applications that reflect a specific scenario and refer to objects in a standardized way, abstracting from concrete implementations of these objects. It’s used in mapping URLs of SAP Fiori applications to objects in the launchpad.\n-   *Action*. Describes which operation, such as display or approve Purchase Orders, is intended to be performed on a semantic object. For example, Purchase Order or Product.\n-   *Title*. The name of the SAP Fiori application that appears on the SAP Fiori launchpad tile in a free text format.\n-   *Subtitle* \\(optional\\). A free text field where the user can further describe the application in the launchpad.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio9bea64e63b824261932d90037ce3c5ae__section_uhj_l2z_t4b\"/>\n\n## Configure Advanced Options\n\nSelect *Yes* if you want to configure advanced options.\n\n-   Select SAPUI5 theme:\n    -   [Quartz Light](https://help.sap.com/viewer/0120a9e442b44ad9925841dde3bc521f/201909.002/en-US/bf53ad16229e4e438dc0ea5c42064cff.html?q=-%09SAP%20Quartz%20Light%20)\n    -   [Belize](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8ec2dae34eb44cbbb560be3f9f1592fe/1709%20002/en-US/977672c6940f48578d08d770bee236f2.html?q=SAP%20Belize)\n\n        > ### Note:  \n        > Belize has been deprecated since SAPUI5 version 1.120 and has been removed from version 1.136 onwards.\n\n    -   [Quartz Dark](https://help.sap.com/viewer/085edb30fb3d413da552832f3d5c01c0/2002.500/en-US/ed83b3029c724c9cb267cc4c6eff1068.html?q=SAP%20quartz%20dark)\n\n        > ### Note:  \n        > Quartz Dark is only available on SAPUI5 versions 1.72 and later.\n\n    -   [Morning Horizon](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/theming/)\n    -   [Evening Horizon](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/theming/)\n\n        > ### Note:  \n        > Morning Horizon and Evening Horizon are shown in the dropdown if the minimum SAPUI5 version selected is **1.102** or above. **Morning Horizon** is selected by default.\n\n\n-   *Add Eslint configuration to the project*.\n\n    Choosing this option includes the SAP Fiori [eslint plugin library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-fiori-custom) in the generated application that allows the developer to check and ensure that the SAP Fiori application adheres to the best practice for SAP Fiori code development. Executing the target `npm run lint` in the generated application checks for any linting errors.\n\n-   *Add JavaScript code assist libraries to your project*\n\n    With this option, libraries are included in the generated project to provide `ui5` code completion prompts in the editor along with the `eslint` rules and recommended configuration for the static `jsdoc` code checks.\n\n    For more information, see [Adding JavaScript Code Assist](adding-javascript-code-assist-5c561ed.md).\n\n-   *Update project to use NPM Workspaces \\(CAP only\\)*\n\n    Optionally update your CAP application to support NPM workspaces which will permit the generated SAP Fiori application to maintain and define the npm libraries it needs inside the application and not at the root of the CAP project. This is a pre-requisite to adding support for TypeScript for SAP Fiori applications in a CAP project.\n\n-   *Enable*TypeScript*\\(Experimental\\)*\n\n    You can optionally choose to generate your application with TypeScript support. This is an experimental feature and is subject to future updates to enhance support.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > TypeScript support in a CAP application requires npm workspaces to be enabled as detailed above.\n\n\n",
