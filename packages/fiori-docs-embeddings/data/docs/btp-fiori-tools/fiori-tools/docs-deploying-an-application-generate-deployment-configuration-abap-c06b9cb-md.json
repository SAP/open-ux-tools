Additional support for OAuth2 authentication is provided for ABAP systems on SAP Business Technology Platform.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loioc06b9cbb3f3641aabfe3a5d199e855a0__section_nv5_bxx_3nb\"/>\n\n## Generation of Deployment Configurations\n\nIn order to create deployment configuration, launch the deployment configuration wizard from the Command Palette entry: `Fiori: Add Deployment Configuration` and chose the SAP Fiori project you would like to configure, or you can launch from the command line using the command: `npx fiori add deploy-config` while in the required SAP Fiori project folder.\n\nYou are prompted for the required information and then the `ui5-deploy.yaml` file is created based on your input and the content of the existing `ui5.yaml` file used for preview. In addition to creating the configuration, the create deployment command will also update your `package.json` file so that you can execute `npm run deploy` afterwards to deploy your application. See [Deployment of Application](deployment-of-application-607014e.md).\n\nWhen prompted, add or choose:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nPlease choose the target\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nABAP\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSelect Target System\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChoose a system from your SAP saved systems or provide a Target system URL\\(VS Code only\\).\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nDestination\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChoose the deployment destination from list provided \\(SAP Business Application Studio only\\).\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nEnter client\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nAdd a new client or leave as default.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSAPUI5 ABAP Repository\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nAdd a name for the deployed application.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nDeployment Description\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nAdd the optional description for the deployed application.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nPackage\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nAdd a valid package name.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nHow do you want to enter Transport Request\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n-   **Enter manually:** Manually provide the transport request.\n-   **Choose from existing:** The applicable list of transport requests and their description is retrieved from the target system and displayed in a list for you to choose from. If the list of transport requests is unable to be retrieved from the target system, a user must provide the entry manually.\n-   **Create new:** A new transport request is automatically created for use. If the transport request is unable to be created from the target system, the user must provide the entry manually. The generated transport request will have the description: Created by SAP Fiori tools for ABAP repository <repository name\\>, where <repository name\\> refers to the name of the deployed application.\n-   **Create during deployment:** The transport request is automatically created the first time the application is deployed. If the transport request is unable to be created from the target system, deployment fails. The generated transport request will have a description: Created by SAP Open UX Tools for ABAP repository <repository name\\>, where <repository name\\> refers to the name of the deployed application.\n\n\n\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nTransport Request\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nWhen prompted, either choose a transport request from the list or add a valid transport request.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If the SSL certificate is invalid because of an expired certificate, wrong host, or unable to verify the leaf signature, you can use the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` environment variable to ignore the error. However, we recommend that you resolve the SSL certificate error rather than ignoring it.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loioc06b9cbb3f3641aabfe3a5d199e855a0__section_a5d_mfd_l4b\"/>\n\n## Example Configuration - ABAP\n\nExecuting `ui5 build --config ui5-deploy.yaml` in your project with the configuration below in a `ui5-deploy.yaml` file manually added to the project, would deploy all files of your `dist` folder except files ending with `.test.js` and the `internal.md` file. The target system is `XYZ` with client 200. Username and password for authentication is read from the environment variables `XYZ_USER` and `XYZ_PASSWORD`.\n\nBased on this example, the application is created and updated as `/TEST/SAMPLE_APP` in package `/TEST/UPLOAD` and all changes is recorded in transport request `XYZQ300582`.\n\nSample **content of the `ui5-deploy.yaml` file:**\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ```\n> builder:\n>   customTasks:\n>   - name: deploy-to-abap\n>     afterTask: replaceVersion\n>     configuration:\n>       target:\n>         url: https://XYZ.sap-system.corp:44311\n>         client: 200\n>         auth: basic\n>       credentials:\n>         username: env:XYZ_USER\n>         password: env:XYZ_PASSWORD\n>       app:\n>         name: /TEST/SAMPLE_APP\n>         package: /TEST/UPLOAD\n>         transport: XYZQ300582\n>       exclude:\n>       - .*\\.test.js\n>       - internal.md\n> ```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loioc06b9cbb3f3641aabfe3a5d199e855a0__section_qdj_kr4_fvb\"/>\n\n## Example Configuration - Additional Params\n\nFor example, you can add additional settings params such as `sap-language` to your `yaml` file.\n\nSample **content of the `ui5-deploy.yaml` file:**\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ```\n> builder:\n>   customTasks:\n>   - name: deploy-to-abap\n>     afterTask: replaceVersion\n>     configuration:\n>       target:\n>         url: https://XYZ.sap-system.corp:44311\n>         client: 200\n>         auth: basic\n>         params: \n>           sap-language: en\n>       credentials:\n>         username: env:XYZ_USER\n>         password: env:XYZ_PASSWORD\n>       app:\n>         name: /TEST/SAMPLE_APP\n>         package: /TEST/UPLOAD\n>         transport: XYZQ300582\n>       exclude:\n>       - .*\\.test.js\n>       - internal.md\n> ```\n\n",
