Right-click the application project `manifest.json`.\n2.  In the context menu, select *Service Manager*.\n3.  Click *Add Service*.\n4.  Choose Connection Type:\n    1.  Destination \\(SAP Business Application Studio\\) - Select the server destination from the dropdown. Enter your username and password if needed.\n    2.  SAP System \\(Visual Studio Code\\) - Select the server SAP System from the dropdown. Enter your username and password if needed.\n    3.  Hostname - Enter the server hostname, SAP Client, and username and password if needed.\n\n5.  To specify the OData service URL:\n    1.  Enter Service URL manually.\n    2.  Fetch Services from the server catalog and select from the dropdown list.\n\n6.  Click *Add*.\n\n    A new service appears in a service list. A service`metadata.xml` is now added to a local service folder of the project along with the service back-end annotations \\(if they’re available\\).\n\n\n\n\n### How to Refresh a Service from the Server\n\n1.  Right-click the SAP Fiori elements application project `manifest.json`.\n2.  In the context menu, select *Service Manager*.\n3.  Click the :pencil2: \\(*Pencil*\\) icon opposite the service.\n4.  Choose Connection Type:\n    1.  Destination \\(SAP Business Application Studio\\) - Select the server destination from the dropdown. Enter your username and password if needed.\n    2.  SAP System \\(Visual Studio Code\\) - Select the server SAP System from the dropdown. Enter your username and password if needed.\n    3.  Hostname - Enter the server hostname, SAP Client, and username and password if needed.\n\n5.  Click\n    -   *Refresh* - Refresh the local copy of service metadata and annotation files.\n    -   *Refresh & Save* - Refresh the local copy of service metadata and annotation files and save connection to UI5 `YAML` files.\n\n\n\n\n### How to Delete a Service:\n\n1.  Right-click the SAP Fiori elements application project `manifest.json`.\n2.  In the context menu, select *Service Manager*.\n3.  Click the :wastebasket: \\(*Delete*\\) icon.\n\nThe `metadata.xml`, related annotation XML files and mockdata is deleted from the project. Also, the `ui5*.yaml` files will remove any back-end routing and mockserver entries specific to the service being deleted.\n\nFor more information about mockserver, see [Use Mock Data](../Previewing-an-Application/use-mock-data-bda83a4.md).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio8182ff3b19574f038bd636b9991aa24e__section_sl5_xd4_ylb\"/>\n\n## Manage OData Annotations Files\n\nThe OData services can have multiple local annotation files associated with a service. The Annotation File Manager can be used to manage local annotation files associated with a service.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Managing annotations is limited to the OData service and not applicable to CAP CDS.\n\n**How to open the Annotation File Manager**\n\n1.  Right-click the `manifest.json` file in the SAP Fiori elements application project.\n2.  In the context menu, select *Annotation File Manager*.\n3.  Select the target service from the drop-down list.\n\nAlternatively, you can click *Annotation Hierarchy* in the **Annotation List View** for a particular projection or property of service.\n\n\n\n### How to add annotation files in the Annotation File Manager:\n\n1.  Right-click the `manifest.json` file in the SAP Fiori elements application project.\n2.  In the context menu, select *Annotation File Manager*.\n3.  Select the target service from the drop-down list.\n4.  Click *Create Local Annotation File*.\n5.  Fill in the criteria required for creating an annotation file.\n6.  Click *Create*.\n\nThe newly created annotation file appears in the *Annotation File Manager* for that service, and also in the *Annotation List View* for the target projection.\n\n\n\n### How to change the hierarchy of local annotation file\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The highest-ranked annotation file in the *Annotation File Manager* table is at the bottom resembling precedence rules in the `manifest.json`.\n\n1.  In the *Annotation File Hierarchy*, use the up/down arrows to change the hierarchy.\n\n![Annotation File Hierarchy](images/Annotations_File_Hierarchy_a7d0242.png)\n\n\n\n### How to activate and deactivate local annotation files:\n\n1.  Right-click the `manifest.json` file and select *Open Annotation File Manager*.\n2.  Select or clear the checkbox in the active column of the *Annotation File Manager* table to activate or deactivate the annotation.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > When a file is deactivated, it’s no longer considered a part of the annotation file hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n### How to delete an annotation file:\n\n1.  Select the active checkbox.\n2.  Click the :wastebasket: \\(*Delete*\\) icon next to the annotation file.\n\n",
