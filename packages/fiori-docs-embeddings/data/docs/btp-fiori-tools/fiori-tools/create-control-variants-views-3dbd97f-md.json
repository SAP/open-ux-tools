For more information, see [SAPUI5 Flexibility: Enable Your App for UI Adaptation](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/f1430c0337534d469da3a56307ff76af) and the `sap.ui.fl.variants.VariantManagement` [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.fl.variants.VariantManagement).\n\n-   To use the `sap.ui.comp.smartvariants.SmartVariantManagement` control, the minimum SAPUI5 version installed on the system must be 1.90 or higher. For more information, see `sap.ui.comp.smartvariants.SmartVariantManagement` [API Reference](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartvariants.SmartVariantManagement).\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio3dbd97f940564b11a8b7baf1e08aa88e__context_ox1_lc2_3kb\"/>\n\n## Context\n\nThe Adaptation Editor allows you to create, load, change, and save control variants. You can create variants of a control to give different options for the end user for better usability in use cases when they do or do not need a specific part of a control.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> You can define variants for specific controls on the user interface. On the user interface, variants are called views.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio3dbd97f940564b11a8b7baf1e08aa88e__steps-unordered_igc_4rp_qqb\"/>\n\n## Procedure\n\nCreating and adapting control variants \\(views\\) is the same process as the key user scenario. You can follow the procedure described in [Creating and Adapting Views](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4fc8d03390c342da8a60f8ee387bca1a/latest/en-US/91ae3492323b42a79ca66fbfaf5af3f9.html). The only difference from the key user scenario is that you do not have to publish your changes. They are saved as an ordinary change in your adaptation project in the same manner as all other changes.\n\n",
