If you want to generate mock data and store it in the `.json` file format, you can right-click on your project and launch *Open Data Editor*. Once generated, mock data is stored in the `.json` format under the `/webapp/localService/mockdata` file.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> You need to configure mock server prior to using `npm run start-mock`. See [Installing MockServer](../Previewing-an-Application/installing-mockserver-2538055.md).\n\nFor templates like the *Overview Page* where there are multiple services, you will see a drop-down list to select the metadata file you want to use. If your application is running, you can stop the mock server by pressing [Ctrl\\] + [C\\] .\n\n![](images/Fiori_Tools_Show_Properties_in_Data_Editor_15deef9.png)\n\nData Editor reads the `metadata.xml` file that is defined in the `manifest.json` under the `dataSource` and generates mock data based on the property type.\n\nData can be edited by either double-clicking in the cell of the Data Editor or by editing the `Entity.json` file.\n\n![manifest.json](images/DataEditor_Manifest_file_0c29c6d.png)\n\nIf the mock server isn’t running, you can:\n\n-   Make changes in the Data Editor, automatically reflected in the `.json` file.\n\n-   If changes are made in the `.json` file, click the *Refresh* button to update the canvas.\n\n\nIf the mock server is running:\n\n-   Add the `watch: true` parameter to the `ui5-mock.yaml` to update the canvas.\n\n    ![ui5-mock.yaml](images/Data_Editor_ui5mockyaml_3e50d51.png)\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio18e43b5a01cf433f86de5ba10e7881c6__section_dbj_4pg_hsb\"/>\n\n## Editing Mock Data\n\n**Editing Data**- edit data by double-clicking in the editable cell. Primary keys and foreign keys aren’t editable.\n\n**Add Row** - add a row by clicking the *Add Row* button. Additional rows will be added automatically to all the entities that are associated with a foreign key.\n\n**Delete Row** - delete a row by selecting a row and clicking the *Delete Row* button. Rows will be automatically deleted on all the entities that are associated with a foreign key.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio18e43b5a01cf433f86de5ba10e7881c6__section_zmb_spm_c5b\"/>\n\n## Searching Mock Data\n\nTo search for mock data, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Click on the *Search* input field in the header bar of the Data Editor.\n2.  Enter search criteria in the search input field.\n3.  Select the mock data that matches the search criteria in the drop-down table. The data you selected is highlighted in the Data Editor table.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio18e43b5a01cf433f86de5ba10e7881c6__section_ogm_fqm_1vb\"/>\n\n## Show and Hide Properties\n\nTo show properties in the Data Editor table, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Click on *Show Properties* in the header bar of the Data Editor to open the popup.\n\n2.  Check the properties you want to display in the Data Editor table.\n\n3.  Click *Save*.\n\n\nTo hide properties in the Data Editor table, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Click on *Show Properties* in the header bar of the Data Editor to open the popup.\n\n2.  Deselect the property that you don't want to display in the Data Editor table.\n\n3.  Click *Save*.\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Certain property groups are hidden by default and can be shown using *Show Properties*. You can also search for a particular property using the search input field in the popup.\n\n",
