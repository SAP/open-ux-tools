In the *Data Source and Service Selection* wizard page, you can select from one of the following options:\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio37a0fcf2388c4e8e9e9e4942e6c5cff4__section_l4w_krq_qpb\"/>\n\n## Connect to an SAP System\n\n-   **Connect to an SAP system using** **VS Code**\n\n    In either case, you can create a system to connect to or select from any saved systems you may have already used.\n\n    *Adding a new system*\n\n    1.  **Enter a system name** that you use to save the connection details for either an on-premise SAP ABAP system or SAP Business Technology Platform system.\n    2.  **Select the SAP ABAP system type**\n\n        For the SAP ABAP system hosted in the SAP Business Technology Platform, you can choose from the following authentication types:\n\n        -   Service Key\n\n        -   Reentrance Ticket\n\n\n        If you choose Service Key authentication, you must provide a service key that contains the key information for the required SAP ABAP system. Your administrator needs to provide this service key for the selected SAP ABAP system. Once this information is available, a browser tab launches and prompts you to authenticate against the system.\n\n        For more information about how to create a service key, see [Create Service Keys Using the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/cdf4f200db3e4c248fa67401937b2f78.html).\n\n        If you choose Reentrance Ticket authentication, provide the URL to your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system and log in when the browser window appears.\n\n        > ### Note:  \n        > Authenticating with reentrance tickets requires SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2408 or higher.\n\n        > ### Note:  \n        > Once you have authenticated your user for the new system in the browser, SAP Fiori application generator shows you the list of OData services available for the user youâ€™ve used to log in. Please see the *Service* dropdown with the title *Service \\(for user \\[<USERNAME\\>\\]\\)*.\n\n        For an on-premise SAP ABAP system, you need to provide the system URL and optional client ID, along with the authentication details for that system if required.\n\n        > ### Example:  \n        > https://someurl:12345, client: 010\n\n\n    In both scenarios, you can store the system details in the secure storage of your operating system.\n\n    -   Microsoft Windows: Keychain.\n    -   macOS: Credential Manager.\n\n    Saving the system in this way ensures that you do not need to continually provide these details for generating an application or running the generated application locally.\n\n    A saved system can be deleted from either of these places, as needed.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > When connecting for the first time, only the *New System* option is available.\n\n-   **Connecting to an SAP System using** **SAP Business Application Studio**\n\n    When using the SAP Fiori application generator in SAP Business Application Studio, you can select from a list of destinations that are configured for a SAP Business Application Studio instance. The generator automatically retrieves the available destinations, and you can select from the list. If you do not have the correct access to use the destination end point, an error occurs.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio37a0fcf2388c4e8e9e9e4942e6c5cff4__section_i2d_yzx_v4b\"/>\n\n## Connect to an OData service with a Customized URL\n\nIf the OData endpoint that you want to use in your application can't be accessed directly, you can set it up as a destination and directly reference it in the generator. To do so, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  In SAP Business Application Studio, launch the SAP Fiori Generator and select the required template.\n2.  Select *Connect to an OData Service* from the data source dropdown list.\n3.  For the data source URL field, use the destination name followed by `.dest`. In this case, SAP Business Application Studio should be able to route to your service with the destination name.\n\n> ### Example:  \n> If the URL defined in the Destination is `https://someurl.com/someservice` with the destination name MyDestination, the following URL will be used in the SAP Fiori generator:\n> \n> `https://MyDestination.dest/someservice`\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio37a0fcf2388c4e8e9e9e4942e6c5cff4__section_cxb_trq_qpb\"/>\n\n## Connect to an OData Service\n\nEnter the OData endpoint URL to generate your application. All OData endpoints that are either authenticated with basic authentication or unauthenticated are supported.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The provided OData endpoint must be the correct version for the template that you select. For example, an OData V2 endpoint must be provided for the OData V2 template. The wizard informs you if there is any mismatch between the OData version and the template version.\n\nIf necessary, the system prompts you to provide your name and password.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio37a0fcf2388c4e8e9e9e4942e6c5cff4__section_pmx_hvq_qpb\"/>\n\n## Upload a Metadata Document\n\nTo generate the application without relying on a back end service being available, upload a `metadata.xml` file that you want to use.\n\nOnly [EDMX format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/mc-edmx/5dff5e25-56a1-408b-9d44-bff6634c7d16) is supported for the `metadata.xml` file.\n\nOnce the `metadata.xml` file has been validated, the system allows you to select the required entity options for the application.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> When using a `metadata.xml` file, the generated application is limited to only mock data.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio37a0fcf2388c4e8e9e9e4942e6c5cff4__section_rqx_lsq_qpb\"/>\n\n## Connect to SAP Business Accelerator Hub\n\n> ### Caution:  \n> SAP Business Accelerator Hub has been deprecated from the Application Generator as a data source and will be removed in a future release. We strongly recommend that you use the Service Center in SAP Business Application Studio to generate applications if you intend to still use SAP Business Accelerator Hub.\n> \n> For more information, see [Service Center](https://help.sap.com/products/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/1e8ec75c9c784b51a91c7370f269ff98.html).\n\nWhen users do not have their data source available, they can generate an application with the SAP Business Accelerator Hub. This data source is only intended to support development and must be replaced with a real data source before going live. When the SAP Business Accelerator Hub option is selected, a list of predefined services relevant to different industries appears.\n\n-   Select a service that you want to generate an application with. For example, Just-In-Time Calls, Transaction Classifications, Content, and Request of Quotation.\n-   Once the service is selected, two more fields appear for authentication purposes: *Enter your Username* and *Enter your Password*.\n-   Fill in the fields and click *Next* to proceed with the application generation.\n\n> ### Caution:  \n> SAP Business Accelerator Hub services are not intended for use with SAP Fiori UI development.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> You cannot deploy applications that use the SAP Business Accelerator Hub, as this data source is intended for local development only.\n\nFor more information, see [https://api.sap.com/](https://api.sap.com/).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio37a0fcf2388c4e8e9e9e4942e6c5cff4__section_fbg_tsq_qpb\"/>\n\n## Use a Local CAP Project\n\nYou can select a local SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \\(CAP\\) project in your filesystem and the generator retrieves the services that are defined for that project. The folder location you provide is validated to ensure it is an SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \\(CAP\\) Node.js project that the generator can support.\n\nFor more information about CAP services, see: [https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/).\n\n",
