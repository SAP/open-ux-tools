Click the *Object/Form Entry Page* to open the *Page Editor*.\n2.  Navigate to the section node in the outline and click the :heavy_plus_sign: \\(*Add*\\) icon.\n\n    As a result, a dropdown menu displaying currently supported section types appears.\n\n3.  Select *Add Form Section* from the dropdown list.\n\n    A pop-up window *Add Form Section* appears with a field to provide a label for the section to be added.\n\n4.  Enter a title to the *Label* field and click *Add*.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > See [Internationalization \\(i18n\\)](internationalization-i18n-eb427f2.md) for translation if there is none.\n\n    A new section tab appears in the application preview of the form and *Object Page*. Now you can add fields to the newly created form section. For more information, see [Adding Filter Fields](filter-fields-0b84286.md#loio0b8428645243486680ffa22c0b541039__addingfilterfields).\n\n\nIn the `annotation` file, you can see the following changes applied:\n\n-   A new `UI.FieldGroup` with the empty `Data` property is added.\n-   A `UI.ReferenceFacet` record is added to the `UI.Facet` annotation with the following properties:\n    -   `Target`, as annotation path pointing to the created `UI.FieldGroup`.\n    -   `Label`, as a string value containing user-entered text.\n    -   `ID`, as a string value auto-generated based on the label.\n\n-   If the `UI.Facet` annotation isn’t yet available, it’s applied to the entity associated with the *Object Page*.\n-   If the `UI.Facet` annotation exists on the underlying layer, the annotation on this layer will be overridden in the local file.\n-   In the case of CAP CDS, a using statement is added to the overridden file.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio4102b3d63d9047c881108e6f0caae15e__section_udp_pxx_xrb\"/>\n\n## Moving Form Section\n\nYou can change the order of sections in the application header. Drag and drop the required section to a different position within the *Header Sections* node:\n\n-   When dropped, the records in the `UI.Facets` collection are reordered.\n-   When the SAP Fiori application is rendered, sections are displayed based on the records sequence in the `UI.HeaderFacets` annotation.\n\n**Move multiple sections**\n\nTo move multiple sections to another position, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Press [Ctrl\\] + [Click\\]  to select more than one section.\n2.  Drag the selected section to the desired position with your pointer.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio4102b3d63d9047c881108e6f0caae15e__section_cwh_qxx_xrb\"/>\n\n## Deleting Form Section\n\nTo delete a section, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Navigate to the section node in the outline.\n2.  Click the :wastebasket: \\(*Delete*\\) icon to open the *Delete Confirmation* pop-up window.\n3.  Click *Delete* to confirm the action.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> This action deletes the `UI.ReferenceFacet` record from `UI.Facets`.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> To remove the unreferenced `UI.FieldGroup` annotation, run the cleanup procedure to delete the unreferenced annotation.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio4102b3d63d9047c881108e6f0caae15e__changeformsectionlabel\"/>\n\n## Maintaining Form Section Properties\n\n\n\n### Label\n\nTo change the section label, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Select the required section and navigate to the properties pane area.\n2.  Enter a new name in the *Label* text box. This field defines the text to be displayed at a section label.\n\n    The section is renamed both in the *Page Editor* and in the application preview.\n\n\nFor more information, see [Label](appendix-457f2e9.md#loiod44832d99bdf4f73ba14cdbb16dc9301).\n\n\n\n### Display on Demand\n\nThe `Display On Demand` switch is displayed in the *Property Panel* for the [Form Section](form-section-4102b3d.md) and [Identification Section](identification-section-b83f501.md) section if they are used as a sub section in a [Group Section](group-section-1894c47.md). Activate it to hide the [Form Section](form-section-4102b3d.md) or [Identification Section](identification-section-b83f501.md) under the *Show More* by default. Click *Show More* to make it visible. Deactive it to always display the section.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> By default, this property is deactivated. Once the user activates it, an embedded annotation `UI.PartOfPreview` is added to the respective `UI.ReferenceFacet` record with boolean value `false`. The embedded annotation will be removed, if the property is switched off again. The embedded annotation is also removed, if the section is moved and not contained in a [Group Section](group-section-1894c47.md) after the move.\n\n\n\n### Hidden\n\nFor more information, see [Hidden](appendix-457f2e9.md#loiof7ad71792a0044d6b6172f078827bdc0).\n\n",
