To do so, select the option`Yes` during the **entity selection** step when generating your application. A default annotation is generated depending on the template and based on the following logic:\n\n![](images/Automatic_Generation_752de82.png)\n\n`UI.FieldGroup`, `UI.Facets`, and `UI.LineItem` annotation terms are generated for the Main Entity type and saved in the local annotation file. This only occurs if these annotation terms aren not defined to avoid overriding them.\n\n-   A `UI.LineItem` annotation is generated for the list report and contains `UI.DataField` records referencing the first properties of the main entity type. Hidden properties and properties of type UUID are excluded.\n-   A `UI.FieldGroup` and `UI.Facets` annotation referencing it in `UI.ReferenceFacet` records are generated on the main entity type for the *Form* and *Object Page*.\n-   `UI.FieldGroup` contains `UI.DataField` records for all the direct properties of the main entity type. Hidden properties are excluded.\n\n",
