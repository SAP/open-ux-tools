View the back end annotation details for your annotation.\n2.  Click the <span class=\"SAP-icons-V5\">ÓÅæ</span> \\(*Copy*\\) icon opposite the **back end annotation**. This gives you a starting point for extending or customizing your application. Use [Maintaining Annotations with Language Server](maintaining-annotations-with-language-server-6fc93f8.md) to maintain your local annotation file.\n\n    If there is only one local annotation file associated to the service in the project, the annotation is copied automatically to that local annotation file. If there are multiple local annotation files associated to that service available in the project, you can choose which local annotation file you would like to copy the annotation to using the selection dropdown.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > You can add multiple local annotations files to your project.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > You can copy local annotations to and from local annotation files. You cannot copy local annotation to backend annotation files.\n\n    ![](images/Overriding_annotations_64a3f74.png)\n\n\n\n\n### Creating Additional Annotation Files\n\n1.  Right click on the `manifest.json` file and click *Open Annotation File Manager*.\n2.  Click *Create Local Annotation File*.\n3.  Enter file name, namespace, and select the intended file folder location.\n4.  Click *Create*.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Additional annotation files can only be created for an OData service and not CAP CDS.\n\n",
