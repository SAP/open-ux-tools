On the travel details page, the app should show:\n> \n> ![Alt Text](Travel_Details.jpeg)\n> \n> The total trip price should equal the price of all the bookings for that trip. If there are no bookings for a trip, the total trip price should be zero.\n> \n> If there are any bookings associated with a trip, then each booking must cost more than zero.\n> \n> Clicking on a booking should allow the user to see more details.\n> ```\n\n![](images/Manage_Travel_App_List_Report_Page_Sketch_4633751.jpg)\n\n![](images/Manage_Travel_App_Object_Page_Sketch_999bcc3.jpg)\n\n",
