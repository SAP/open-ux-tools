For more information, see [System Landscapes in SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/a630d57fc5004c6383e7a81efee7a8bb/aa60b129af7b4ce8ae052618c8315d29.html).\n-   [Releasing an SAP Fiori Application to Be Extensible in Adaptation Projects on SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP BTP, ABAP Environment](releasing-an-sap-fiori-application-to-be-extensible-in-adaptation-projects-on-sap-s-4hana-1046206.md).\n-   A destination for the development tenant exists. For more information, see [Create a Destination to Connect to SAP Business Application Studio](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/6aa39f1ac05441e5a23f484f31e477e7/0af2819bbe064a3da455753c8518dd81.html).\n-   The developer requires the following business catalogs: The application that will be adapted must be released for extensibility using adaptation projects. For more information, see:\n    -   Development - UI Deployment \\(SAP\\_A4C\\_BC\\_DEV\\_UID\\_PC\\)\n    -   Business catalog to retrieve the list of extensible apps \\(for example SAP\\_A4C\\_BC\\_DEV\\_OBJ\\_DIS\\_PC\\)\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiof4881a9b9141430dba1c6a76e7f456dc__section_jj3_gzp_d1c\"/>\n\n## Context\n\nThe following diagram shows the relationship between the source application \\(shown in light blue\\) and the application variant created by adaptation project \\(shown in dark blue\\).\n\n![](images/AdaptationProjectS4HCarchitecture_f84e21c.png)\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The application that will be adapted must be released for extensibility using adaptation. You can use source control, such as Git, to maintain your project source code.\n> \n> You must use the project source code to preview and modify it.
