Commands like `node` or `cds`, which are usually part of the `PATH` variable and which can be executed from any directory in the terminal, need to point to a trusted origin.\n\n-   For more information about security, see [Security](../Deploying-an-Application/security-8a147c6.md).\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[SAP Fiori tools FAQ](https://help.sap.com/viewer/42532dbd1ebb434a80506113970f96e9/Latest/en-US)\n\n[SAP Fiori tools Community](https://answers.sap.com/tags/73555000100800002345)\n\n[Contact SAP Support](https://help.sap.com/viewer/1bb01966b27a429ebf62fa2e45354fea/Latest/en-US)\n\n",
