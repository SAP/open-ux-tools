It can contain a group of sections of any type except custom sections. The group section canâ€™t contain fields/columns or actions. With several nested group sections, you can build a nested tree of sections.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> [Defining and Adapting Sections](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/facfea09018d4376acaceddb7e3f03b6).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio1894c471d7aa4121964e497d5ffa3118__section_d3x_4sx_xrb\"/>\n\n## Adding Group Section or Subsections\n\nTo add a Group section or subsections, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Click the Object/Form Entry Page to open the *Page Editor*.\n2.  Navigate to the section layer and click the :heavy_plus_sign: \\(*Add*\\) icon.\n\n    As a result, a dropdown menu displaying currently supported section type appears.\n\n3.  Select *Add Group Section* from the dropdown list.\n\n    A new pop-up window *Add Group Section* appears with a field to provide a label for the section to be added.\n\n4.  Enter a title in the *Label*text box and click *Add*.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > Internally, a new entry is added to the annotation `UI.Facets`. This entry is of the type `UI.CollectionFacet` with corresponding property Label and property Facets being set to an empty array. If `UI.Facets` does not exist yet or is not present in the changeable annotation file, managing process is the same as when adding a new Form section.\n\n    A new Group tab appears in the application preview.\n\n\n\n\n### Add Subsections\n\n1.  Navigate to the Subsections node and click the :heavy_plus_sign: \\(*Add*\\) icon.\n2.  Select the required section from the list, such as Form Section.\n\n    A new pop-up window *Add Form Section* appears with a field to provide a label for the section to be added.\n\n3.  Enter a title in the *Label* text box and click *Add*.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> In the new Form section, you can perform the same actions as in the classic [Form Section](form-section-4102b3d.md), such as adding, editing, moving, and deleting fields.\n\nLabel properties can be prepared for translation. For more information, see [Internationalization \\(i18n\\)](internationalization-i18n-eb427f2.md). In addition, see [Edit in Source Code](edit-in-source-code-7d8e942.md) feature to navigate to code fragments in the annotation file.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio1894c471d7aa4121964e497d5ffa3118__section_udp_pxx_xrb\"/>\n\n## Moving Sections\n\nSections in the Group section can be moved as follows:\n\n-   Within a Group section.\n-   Between different Group sections.\n-   To the top level and back.\n\nBy using the drag-and-drop functionality, drag the required section to a different position.\n\nFor more information, see [Move Basic Fields](basic-fields-2953503.md#loio2953503145dd428194c6dff252744ac1__movebasicfields).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio1894c471d7aa4121964e497d5ffa3118__section_cwh_qxx_xrb\"/>\n\n## Deleting Group Section or Subsection\n\nTo delete the section in the application, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Navigate to the section layer.\n2.  Click the :wastebasket: \\(*Delete*\\) icon to open the *Delete Confirmation* popup window.\n3.  Click *Delete* to confirm the action.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> During deletion of the group section, the respective `UI.CollectionFacet` record is deleted from the `UI.Facets` annotation along with all its content.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> To clean up the unreferenced annotations for the deleted section content, you need to run the cleanup procedure that deletes the unreferenced annotation.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio1894c471d7aa4121964e497d5ffa3118__section_yn2_2qb_zrb\"/>\n\n## Maintaining Group Section Properties\n\n\n\n### Label\n\nTo change the section label, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Select the required section and navigate to the properties pane area.\n2.  Enter a new name in the *Label* text box. This field defines the text to be displayed at a section label.\n\n    The section is renamed both in the *Page Editor* and in the application preview.\n\n\nFor more information, see [Label](appendix-457f2e9.md#loiod44832d99bdf4f73ba14cdbb16dc9301).\n\n\n\n### Hidden\n\nFor more information, see [Hidden](appendix-457f2e9.md#loiof7ad71792a0044d6b6172f078827bdc0).\n\n",
