To do so, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  From the left-side toolbar, click *Run Configurations*.\n\n    The run configuration pane appears.\n\n2.  In the left pane, click the :heavy_plus_sign: \\(*Add*\\) icon to create a new configuration.\n\n    A dialog box appears.\n\n3.  In the option *What would you like to run?*, you are prompted to select the project for which you want to create the configuration.\n4.  Fill in the following sections:\n\n    -   *Name* \\(**mandatory**\\) - You can change the name.\n    -   *Endpoint*\\(**mandatory**\\) - Select the HTML file that is used when the application is started.\n    -   *Mock Data* - Runs your application with a mock server which will mock the OData requests.\n    -   *Support Assistant* - Enables application developers to check whether their applications are built according to the best practices for building SAPUI5 applications. The tool uses a set of pre-defined rules to check all aspects of an application.\n    -   *URL Components* - Enables application developer to define additional URL parameters and/or hash fragment for the SAP Fiori launchpad intent-based navigation.\n    -   *Advanced Settings* - Enables the application developer to define which SAPUI5 version will be used during runtime and/or change the destinations that are used by the application.\n\n        Additionally the application developer can choose to download the SAPUI5 sources for a specific version by selecting *Use local SAPUI5 sources*. The downloaded SAPUI5 libraries are then used when running the preview. When *Use local SAPUI5 sources* is selected for preview, then the option *Run with mock data* is automatically selected.\n\n\n    Click [Save\\]\n\n5.  The new launch configuration appears in the *Run and Debug* pane on the left and also in the table on the UI..\n6.  To run the project, click on the [\\>\\] - icon in the *Actions* section. Alternatively you can select the*Run Configuration* from the drop-down list in the *Run and Debug* pane and click the <span class=\"SAP-icons-V5\">î…‹</span> \\(*Start Debugging*\\) icon.\n\nAdditionally, in the *Run Configuration Pane* you can perform the following actions:\n\n-   **Bind/Unbind SAPUI5 Version:** Quick actions for changing the UI5 version of the run configuration.\n-   **Bind/Unbind Data Source:**Quick action for changing the destination of the run configuration.\n-   **Rename:** right-click on the run configuration and choose Rename to provide a new name for the selected run configuration.\n-   **Show in File:** right-click on the run configuration and choose Show File to open the JSON file containing the set of configuration properties, with the name highlighted.\n-   **Delete:** right-click on the run configuration and choose Delete to delete the run configuration.\n\n",
