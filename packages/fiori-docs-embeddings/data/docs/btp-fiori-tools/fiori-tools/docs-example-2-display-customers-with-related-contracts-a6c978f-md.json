Name\n> 2. Identification Number\n> 3. Address\n> 4. Contract Information\n> A contract is referencing a customer. One customer can have multiple contracts. Attributes of a contract include:\n> 5. Contract ID: A unique identifier for the contract\n> 6. Customer: Information about the customer involved\n> 7. Contract Type: The type of contract (sales, service, employment)\n> 8. Start Date: The date on which the contract becomes valid\n> 9. End Date: The date on which the contract expires (if applicable)\n> 10. Status: The current status of the contract (draft, active, expired, terminated, etc.)\n> \n> When starting the CAP application I first want to see a list of customers.\n> \n> When selecting a specific row in that list, I want to see to a page with details of that customer.\n> \n> It should show the following sections:\n> - section \"Customer Info\" displaying the attributes of the selected customer\n> - section \"Contracts\" showing a list of all contracts for this customer\n> \n> When selecting a specific row in the contracts list, I want to see a page with details of that contract. This page should show two sections:\n> - section \"Contract Info\" containing:\n>   - contract ID\n>   - Customer Name\n>   - Contract Type\n>   - Status\n> - section \"Validity\" containing\n>   - Start Date\n>   - End Date\n> ```\n\n",
