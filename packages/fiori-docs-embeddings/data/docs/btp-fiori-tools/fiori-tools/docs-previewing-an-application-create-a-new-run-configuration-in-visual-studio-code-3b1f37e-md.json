To add custom configuration files for your project, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  From the Command Palette \\([CMD/CTRL\\] + [Shift\\] + [P\\] \\), execute the`Fiori: Open Run Configurations` command.\n2.  Select the project that you want to add a new configuration and press [Enter\\] to confirm your input.\n3.  The existing run configurations for the selected project are displayed. Click *Create*.\n4.  Fill in the following sections:\n\n    -   *Name* \\(**mandatory**\\) - You can change the name.\n    -   *Endpoint*\\(**mandatory**\\) - Select the HTML file that is used when the application is started.\n    -   *Mock Data* - Runs your application with a mock server which will mock the OData requests.\n    -   *Support Assistant* - Enables application developers to check whether their applications are built according to the best practices for building SAPUI5 applications. The tool uses a set of pre-defined rules to check all aspects of an application.\n    -   *URL Components* - Enables application developer to define additional URL parameters and/or hash fragment for the SAP Fiori launchpad intent-based navigation.\n    -   *Advanced Setting*- Enables the application developer to define which SAPUI5 version will be used during runtime and/or change the destinations that are used by the application.\n\n        Additionally the application developer can choose to download the SAPUI5 sources for a specific version by selecting *Use local SAPUI5 sources*. The downloaded SAPUI5 libraries are then used when running the preview. When *Use local SAPUI5 sources* is selected for preview, then the option *Run with mock data* is automatically selected.\n\n\n    Click *Save*\n\n5.  The new launch configuration appears in the *Run and Debug* pane on the left and also in the table on the UI.\n6.  To run the project, click on the \\> icon in the *Actions* section of the table.
