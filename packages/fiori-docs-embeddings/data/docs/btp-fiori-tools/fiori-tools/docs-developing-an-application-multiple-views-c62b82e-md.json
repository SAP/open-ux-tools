The user of your application can switch between views using an icon tab bar. The tables in the views can be based on any entity in your service. The charts can be based on any entity as long as it contains aggregable and groupable properties.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Groupable and aggregable properties are defined on the service level with`@Aggregation.ApplySupported`. If it is not provided, you cannot generate chart views with *Page Editor*. If you want to use custom aggregations for chart measures, your service should also have properties aggregated with `@Aggregation.CustomAggregate`.\n\nIf you want to use the transformation aggregations, make sure your app runs with SAPUI5 version 1.106 or higher to ensure transformation aggregation with `@Analytics.AggregatedProperty` is supported. Transformation aggregation with `@Analytics.AggregatedProperties` isn't supported as this annotation is deprecated in favor of `@Analytics.AggregatedProperty`, see [OData Analytics](https://sap.github.io/odata-vocabularies/vocabularies/Analytics.html).\n\n> ### Note:  \n> You cannot configure multiple views if your *List Report* is configured to display an *Analytical Chart* above or as alternative to the main *List Report* table. For more information, see [Analytical Chart](analytical-chart-9c086ec.md). You can delete an *Analytical Chart* to enable adding views.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loioc62b82e124a74c1684f0d51f0db41c81__section_l5k_mcb_15b\"/>\n\n## Adding a Table or Chart View\n\n1.  In the *Page Editor* for the *List Report* page, click the :heavy_plus_sign: \\(*Add*\\) icon on the Views node.\n2.  In the popup menu, click *Add Table View* or *Add Chart View*. A popup dialog allows to choose an `Entity` from the OData Service. If you chose to *Add Chart View*, you are also prompted for the minimum required data to generate a chart: chart type, a dimension, and a measure.\n\n    A measure can be specified by selecting one of the following:\n\n    -   Use existing measure\n    -   Create new measure\n\n    If you choose to use an existing measure, select one of the available measures defined with custom or transformation aggregations in the *Name* field.\n\n    If you choose to create new measure, choose the *aggregable* property and one of the supported aggregation methods.\n\n    This allows you to create a new dynamic measure and use it in the chart.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > The technical name and the label are generated automatically . You can then adjust the generated label in the *Property Panel*.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > Create new measure only works with transformation aggregations so it should be used for apps run with SAPUI5 version **1.106** or **higher**. If all the possible measures based on all the aggregable properties and supported aggregation methods are already defined in the project, you cannot create a new measure. Use an existing measure instead.\n\n3.  Click *Add* in the dialog. In the Page Editor, a new subnode is appended to the Views node with generated view label.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > The table is added with no columns. You can add columns using the :heavy_plus_sign: \\(*Add*\\) icon for the *Columns* subnode.\n\n\nThe following changes take place in the annotation file:\n\n-   `UI.LineItem` or `UI.Chart` annotation with qualifier is generated targeting the `EntityType` referenced by the selected `EntitySet`.\n-   If you chose to create a new measure, `@Analytics.AggregatedProperty` is applied to the selected aggregable property with your chosen aggregation method.\n-   `Views/Paths` section in `manifest.json` is generated or appended with an entry pointing to the generated `UI.SelectionPresentationVariant`. If different from the main `EntitySet` of the, *List Report* the chosen `EntitySet` is added to the paths entry.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If the `Views/Paths` section in the `manifest.json` file did not exist before, a second entry is created with the table or chart view, with the first entry representing the original table.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loioc62b82e124a74c1684f0d51f0db41c81__section_nm3_hwh_15b\"/>\n\n## Moving Table or Chart View\n\nAll table or chart views are represented as subnodes of the *views* node. Drag and drop them or use the corresponding <span class=\"SAP-icons-V5\"></span> \\(*Move Up*\\) or <span class=\"SAP-icons-V5\"></span> \\(*Move Down*\\) icons to change the view sequence in the *List Report* page.\n\n![Nodes example for List Report](images/Fiori_tools_List_Report_Multi_Views_Nodes_Example_f32ee78.png)\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loioc62b82e124a74c1684f0d51f0db41c81__section_pxg_3wh_15b\"/>\n\n## Deleting Table or Chart View\n\nTo remove a table or chart view, click the :wastebasket: \\(*Delete*\\) icon on the corresponding *views* node.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> It's not possible to remove the last table view that is based on the main entity set of the *List Report*.\n\nIf all views except the last table view are deleted, the *List Report* is implicitly converted into a plain *List Report*:\n\n-   `Views/Paths` section in the `manifest.json` file is removed.\n-   If needed: `defaultTemplateAnnotationPath` in the `manifest.json` file is created to point to an `UI.SelectionPresentationVariant`.\n-   Views do not display any subnodes: details of the *List Report*, such as columns and actions, can be maintained in the *Table* node.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loioc62b82e124a74c1684f0d51f0db41c81__section_ecv_4mx_d5b\"/>\n\n## Table or Chart View Properties\n\n**View Label**\n\nView label is a text used to indicate a view on an icon tab bar above the table or chart. It is auto-generated when you add a view. You can change the generated label by entering the text that is meaningful in your application context.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The view label can be prepared for translation. For more information, see [Internationalization \\(i18n\\)](internationalization-i18n-eb427f2.md).\n\n**Presentation Variant**\n\nThe `Presentation Variant` property lets you define the representation of the table or chart data such as sorting.\n\nThe `Presentation Variant` property lets you sort the table data and is maintained the same way as in the standard *List Report* table. For more information, see [Table](table-aaff7b1.md).\n\nThe `Presentation Variant` for the chart view is maintained the same way as in the [Analytical Chart](analytical-chart-9c086ec.md).\n\n> ### Note:  \n> As different views in the *List Report* are not necessary based on the same entity, you cannot reuse the same `Presentation Variant` for different views. For this reason, the options `From Chart` or `From Table` are not provided. To have the same representation of different views, just define the same options for each related view.\n\n",
