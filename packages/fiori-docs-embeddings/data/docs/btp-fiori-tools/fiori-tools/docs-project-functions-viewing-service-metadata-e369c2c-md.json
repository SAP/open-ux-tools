You can expand the entity node to view all the associated properties for that entity. You can expand the sections for *Complex Types* and *Entity Containers* to see the associated properties and entity sets. The namespace is hidden from the metadata by default. You can click the :gear: \\(*Settings*\\) icon to toggle it on.\n\nProperties that are the primary key of the entity or projection are identified by a :key: \\(*Key*\\) icon.\n\nEntities or properties that have annotations associated with them are identified by an <span class=\"SAP-icons-V5\"></span> \\(*Annotations*\\) icon. You can filter them to only view the metadata targets that have annotations.\n\nYou can select a specific node to see the related annotations in the side panel. The annotation panel lists the annotation files and the associated annotations for the entities and the properties in the main list.\n\n![](images/Fiori_Tools_Service_Modeler_-_Toggle_Namespace_2864d9a.png)\n\n\n\n### Search for Entities, Properties, or Annotations\n\nThe search functionality is available in the Service Modeler toolbar.\n\nWhen you enter a phrase in the search input field, results matching the input term are filtered on the screen. If the search matches an entity name, then all the child properties are also displayed and the associated data is filtered in the annotation side panel.\n\nIf the search term matches an annotation term, all the associated data is filtered in the list.\n\n![](images/Screenshot_Service_Modeler_Country_search_2b1e728.png)\n\n",
