The basic file structure is set up according to our best practices.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> This template does not include Node.js features and is intended for standalone use. If you want to convert it to a launchpad app you have to add some features manually, such as the *Save as Tile* feature.\n\n  \n  \n**Screenshot of the Basic App**\n\n![](images/Basic_Template_2f7b02c.png \"Screenshot of the Basic App\")\n\nThe `index.html` file defines the page that is displayed when the app is started. It is located in the `webapp` folder. It contains an XML view with a header and a title from the `sap.m` library as a starting point. You can easily modify the app to add more functionality.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio14fdcc0a9d834090a07435cfef962b01__section_sgm_1yw_k1b\"/>\n\n## Integrated Tests\n\n  \n  \n**Test for the Basic App**\n\n![](images/BasicTemplate_Tests_213d5d3.png \"Test for the Basic App\")\n\nAn important best practice is to have unit and integration tests for your app. With this template, we have included sample tests that you can use: Tests on formatters and the app controller are the basic tests any app should cover. You can find them in the `test` subfolder of the `webapp` folder.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio14fdcc0a9d834090a07435cfef962b01__section_els_xvw_k1b\"/>\n\n## Where Can I Find the Basic Template?\n\nYou can find the basic template in SAP Fiori tools.\n\n",
