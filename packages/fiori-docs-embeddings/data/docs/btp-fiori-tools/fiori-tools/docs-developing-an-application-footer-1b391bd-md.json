Header actions are based on the `UI.DataFieldForAction` records with `Determining` property set to `true` in `UI.Identification` annotation that is applied to the main entity.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> External navigation actions cannot be set in the *Footer*, irrespective of the `Determining` value.\n\nYou can add, delete and maintain the footer actions in the same way as the actions based on `UI.DataFieldForAction` described in [Table Actions](table-actions-da1931b.md).\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The properties *Importance* and *Requires Context* are not relevant for the header actions.\n> \n> The *Criticality* property impacts the sequence of the actions in the *Object Page* footer. Therefore, once you change its value from *None* to *Positive* or *Negative* \\(or the other way around\\), the sequence of the action nodes in the *Page Editor* outline view is automatically updated.\n\nYou can move actions from the *Footer* to the page header and to the *Form* sections based on the main entity of the page, as long as these actions are not semantically highlighted.\n\n",
