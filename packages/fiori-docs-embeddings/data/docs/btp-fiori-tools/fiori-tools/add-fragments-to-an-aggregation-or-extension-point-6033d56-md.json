In your workspace, from the project context menu, click *Adaptation Editor*.\n\n    The application opens in the canvas in preview mode.\n\n2.  From the editor header, click *Edit*.\n\n3.  On the UI, select a control \\(such as a smart filter bar or an overflow toolbar\\), and from its context menu, click *Add Fragment*.\n\n    In the dialog box that opens, the default target aggregation and last index are selected. A list displays the fragments available for the selected target aggregation. You can also create fragments. Choose the target aggregation and the index from the list where you want to add the fragment. You cannot reuse the same fragment multiple times.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > The index is disabled for **controlConfiguration** aggregation in the control Smart Filter Bar. This aggregation currently does not support positioning at a specific index.\n\n    > ### Tip:  \n    > You can use the quick actions in the top-right panel for the most common cases. To add a fragment, click on the action, enter a name for the fragment file, and choose *Create*. The generated file will contain dummy data, so you can immediately see the result in the preview when you press *Save and Reload* in the toolbar. You can then edit the generated file as needed for your extended app. The following quick actions for are provided for adding fragments:\n    > \n    > -   Add Custom Page Action\n    > -   Add Custom Table Action\n    > -   Add Custom Table Column\n    > -   Add Header Field\n    > -   Add Custom Section\n\n4.  To create a fragment:\n\n    1.  Click *Create New*.\n\n        The default target aggregation is the one you selected in the previous step.\n\n    2.  Enter a name for the fragment and click *Create*.\n\n        A `fragment.xml` file is created in the folder: *Your project name* \\> *webapp* \\> *changes* \\> *fragments* and opens in the editor.\n\n    3.  Define the fragment. Save and close the `.xml` file. For more information, see [SAPUI5 documentation](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/2c677b574ea2486a8d5f5414d15e21c5).\n\n        An associated `addXML.change` file is created for every fragment in the folder: *Your project name* \\> *webapp* \\> *changes*. This change file contains the reference to the `fragment.xml` file, selected target aggregation, and index.\n\n\n5.  To choose an existing fragment from the list:\n\n    1.  Select a fragment from the list and click *Add*.\n\n    2.  Double click the `fragment.xml` file from the workspace to open it in the editor.\n\n    3.  Edit the code to modify the properties of the fragment. Save and close the `.xml` file.\n\n\n6.  Navigate to the canvas to see the changes that you made.\n\n    After adding fragments, you are prompted to reload the Adaptation Editor to see your changes.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > You must add the definition of the namespace of the controls you are going to use inside of the fragment. Also, you must use stable and unique IDs for the controls you define.\n    > \n    > Example:\n    > \n    > ```\n    > <core:FragmentDefinition xmlns:core='sap.ui.core' xmlns:uxap='sap.uxap'>\n    >  <uxap:ObjectPageSection  id=\"sample.Id\" title=\"Title\"></uxap:ObjectPageSection>\n    > </core:FragmentDefinition>\n    > ```\n    > \n    > Also, follow the specific rule each control has for its definition.\n\n    > ### Remember:  \n    > You can delete the fragments that you create. Delete the change files associated to a fragment and then delete the fragment. If you do not, you cannot add fragments to the adaptation project.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio6033d5678a3e4416abf022624dcd5043__extensionpoint\"/>\n\n## Add Fragments to an Extension Point\n\n\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n-   You are using a freestyle SAPUI5 application that has extension points for basis of your adaptation project.\n\n\n\n### Procedure\n\n1.  In your workspace, from the project context menu, click *Adaptation Editor*.\n\n    The application opens in the canvas in preview mode.\n\n2.  From the editor header, click *Edit*.\n\n3.  If you expand the outline tree, you can see which element is a possible extension point. Then, you can select the element in the tree and see its parent marked and highlighted in the visual part of the editor. You can then right click on that highlighted element and click *Add fragment at extension point*.\n\n    In the dialog box that opens, the default extension point is selected. A list displays the fragments available for the selected extension point. You can also create fragments. Choose the target extension point and the index from the list where you want to add the fragment. You cannot reuse the same fragment multiple times.\n\n4.  To create a fragment:\n\n    1.  Click *Create New*.\n\n        The default extension point is the one you selected in the previous step.\n\n    2.  Enter a name for the fragment and click *Create*.\n\n        A `fragment.xml` file is created in the folder: *Your project name* \\> *webapp* \\> *changes* \\> *fragments* and opens in the editor.\n\n    3.  Define the fragment. Save and close the `.xml` file. For more information, see [SAPUI5 documentation](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/2c677b574ea2486a8d5f5414d15e21c5).\n\n        An associated `addXML.change` file is created for every fragment in the folder: *Your project name* \\> *webapp* \\> *changes*. This change file contains the reference to the`fragment.xml` file, selected target aggregation, and index.\n\n\n5.  To choose an existing fragment from the list:\n\n    1.

Delete the change files associated to a fragment and then delete the fragment. If you do not delete them, you will cannot add further fragments to the adaptation project.\n\n\n",
