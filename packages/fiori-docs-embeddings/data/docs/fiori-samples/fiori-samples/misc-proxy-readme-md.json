  "content": "# Defining Proxy Settings for SAP Fiori Tools\n\n# Overview\n\nIn some environments, you may need to configure proxy settings to allow SAP Fiori tools to connect to external services or resources. This is particularly relevant when working in corporate networks or environments with strict firewall rules.\n\n# Prerequisites\n- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to modify environment variables on your system.\n- Confirm with your IT Admin if proxy settings are required for your network environment, for example, in some instances internal networks may not require proxy settings.\n- Unless specified by your IT Admin, do not use `https://` in the proxy URL, the default should be `http://` for the proxy URL.\n\n# Setting Up Proxy Environment Variables using UI5 YAML Configuration\n\nThe `ui5.yaml` file is used to configure the proxy settings for SAP Fiori tools. You can define the proxy settings in the `ui5.yaml` file as follows:\n\n```yaml\n- name: fiori-tools-proxy\n  afterMiddleware: compression\n  configuration:\n    proxy: http://myproxy.com:8443\n    backend:\n    - path: /sap\n      url: https://my.backend.com:1234\n```\n\nIf you need to pass credentials, then the proxy URL should be in the format `http://user:password@proxyserver:port`.\n\nRefer to [@sap/ux-ui5-tooling](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling#providing-proxy-configuration) API guide for more information.\n\n# Setting Up Proxy Environment Variables\n\nThe typical settings used for connecting to a proxy server include:\n\n```bash\nexport HTTP_PROXY=http://user:password@proxyserver:port\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:password@proxyserver:port\nexport NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,internal.domain,.local\n```\n\n## Key Parts\n\n`HTTP_PROXY`: For regular HTTP connections\n`HTTPS_PROXY`: For secure HTTPS connections\n`NO_PROXY`: Comma-separated list of hosts/domains that should bypass the proxy\n\nCommon variations:\n\nLowercase versions: http_proxy, https_proxy, no_proxy\nProtocol-specific format: https:// instead of http:// for the HTTPS_PROXY URL\nSystem-specific settings (Windows vs. Linux/macOS)\n\nThese environment variables are recognized by most applications and command-line tools to route network traffic through the specified proxy server. Again, you will need to confirm this with your IT Admin.\n\n# Setting Up Proxy Environment Variables for Deployment\n\nRefer to the [SAP Axios Extension](https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-tools/tree/main/packages/axios-extension#proxy-support) for more information on setting up proxy environment variables for deployment.\n\nTo enable support for TLS (Transport Layer Security), enable the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable, as shown;\n\n```bash\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=<YOUR-PROXY:PORT>\n```\n\nTo support credentials in the proxy URL, you can set the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable to include the username and password in the URL. For example:\n\n```bash\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:password@proxy.domain.com:3128\n```\n\nIf your password contains special characters, for example, if your password is configured as `p@s#w0rd`, then you will need to escape it `p%40s%23w0rd`:\n```bash\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=http://myusername:p%40s%23w0rd@proxy.domain.com:3128\n```\n\nRefer to this link to translate special characters in URLs [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/).\n\nIf using an earlier version of [@sap/ux-ui5-tooling](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling?activeTab=versions), for example v1.17.6, you may need to enable the patch proxy feature by setting the `TOOLSUITE_FEATURES` environment variable:\n\n```bash\nexport TOOLSUITE_FEATURES=sap.ux.enablePatchProxy\n```\n\nThe feature `sap.ux.enablePatchProxy` is enabled by default in the latest versions of the SAP Fiori tools, so you may not need to set this variable.\n\n# Defining Proxy Settings\n\n\n## Windows PowerShell Commands\nHere are the PowerShell commands to set those proxy environment variables:\n\n```powershell\n$env:HTTP_PROXY = \"http://user:password@proxyserver:port\"\n$env:HTTPS_PROXY = \"http://user:password@proxyserver:port\"\n$env:NO_PROXY = \"localhost,127.0.0.1,internal.domain,.local\"\n```\nIf you want to set these permanently for your user account (so they persist across PowerShell sessions), use:\n```powershell\n[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"HTTP_PROXY\", \"http://user:password@proxyserver:port\", \"User\")\n[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"HTTPS_PROXY\", \"http://user:password@proxyserver:port\", \"User\")\n[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"NO_PROXY\", \"localhost,127.0.0.1,internal.domain,.local\", \"User\")\n```\nOr if you need them, set system-wide for all users (requires administrator privileges):\n```powershell\n[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"HTTP_PROXY\", \"http://user:password@proxyserver:port\", \"Machine\")\n[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"HTTPS_PROXY\", \"http://user:password@proxyserver:port\", \"Machine\")\n[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"NO_PROXY\", \"localhost,127.0.0.1,internal.domain,.local\", \"Machine\")\n```\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with PowerShell, you can also set these variables through the Windows GUI:\n\n1. Right-click on \"This PC\" or \"Computer\" on the desktop or in File Explorer.\n2. Select \"Properties\".\n3. Click on \"Advanced system settings\" on the left sidebar.\n4. In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n5. In the Environment Variables window, you can add or edit the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` variables under either \"User variables\" or \"System variables\".\n6. Click \"OK\" to save your changes.\n7. Restart any open command prompts or applications to ensure they pick up the new environment variables.\n\n## MacOS/Linux\n\nHere are the bash commands to set those proxy environment variables:\n```bash\n# Set for current session only\nexport HTTP_PROXY=http://user:password@proxyserver:port\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:password@proxyserver:port\nexport NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,internal.domain,.local\n```\n\nIf you want to set these permanently so they persist across terminal sessions, add them to your shell profile file:\n```bash\necho 'export HTTP_PROXY=http://user:password@proxyserver:port' >> ~/.bashrc\necho 'export HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:password@proxyserver:port' >> ~/.bashrc\necho 'export NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,internal.domain,.local' >> ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nThen reload your profile:\n```bash\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n### License\nCopyright (c) 2009-2025 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.
