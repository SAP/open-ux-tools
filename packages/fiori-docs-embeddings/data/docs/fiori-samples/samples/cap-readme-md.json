It guides developers along a ‘golden path’ of proven best practices and a great wealth of out-of-the-box solutions to recurring tasks.\n\nThis repository provides sample CAP projects using different router configurations and the steps required to deploy to Cloud Foundry;\n\n1. [Managed Approuter](../cap/cap-fiori-mta/README.md) with SAP Hana Cloud service\n\n2. [Standalone Approuter](../cap/cap-fiori-mta-standalone/README.md) with an in-memory database\n\n3. [Managed Approuter with CDS Hybrid Profile](../cap/cap-fiori-hybrid/README.md) supporting HANA and XSUAA services hosted on SAP BTP\n\n4. [Create a SAP BTP Destination exposing CAP services](../cap/destination/README.md), also supports cross subaccount and regions\n\nAll CAP projects were generated using the steps outlined in this [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/10/build-and-deploy-a-cap-project-node.js-api-with-a-sap-fiori-elements-ui-and-a-managed-approuter-configuration/) selecting the appropriate router configuration as the HTML5 application runtime.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\nFor more information on integrating CI/CD into your CAP deployment strategy, please refer to the [Continuous Integration and Delivery YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvWSHSZFPok).\n\n### License\nCopyright (c) 2009-2025 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.
