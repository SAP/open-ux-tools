However, if you reuse or nest these views, these stable IDs are no longer unique. To avoid ambiguity, each view adds its own ID as prefix to all its child controls.\n\nIf the ID is created during instantiation of the control, it is unique by default. If you create further controls during runtime, the controller creates a unique ID by calling the `oController.createId(\"ID\")` method. These methods add the necessary prefix to the ID.\n\nIf you want to modify the control with the ID `<ID>`, you can call the `byId(<ID>)` method on your view to get the correct control directly. You do not have to handle all the prefix stuff on your own.\n\nThe following view defines a button with the stable ID `aButton` \\(in the `ButtonView`\\):\n\n```html\n<mvc:View viewName=\"sap.hcm.ButtonView\" controllerName=\"sap.hcm.myController\" xmlns=\"sap.m\" xmlns:mvc=\"sap.ui.core.mvc\">\n      <Button id=\"aButton\" text=\"Click me\"/><mvc:View>\n```\n\nThe following view defines a view embedding the same view several times \\(`ContainerView`\\):\n\n```html\n<mvc:View viewName=\"sap.hcm.ContainerView\" controllerName=\"sap.hcm.Address\" xmlns=\"sap.ui.commons\" xmlns:core=\"sap.ui.core\"\n           xmlns:html=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n      <mvc:View id=\"ButtonView1\" viewName=\"sap.hcm.ButtonView\"/>\n      <mvc:View id=\"ButtonView2\" viewName=\"sap.hcm.ButtonView\"/>\n<mvc:View>\n```\n\nThe view is created as follows:\n\n```js\n...\n   // \"View\" required from module \"sap/ui/core/mvc/View\"\n   View.create().then(function(oView) {/* code */});\n...\n```\n\nThe container view has the following IDs:\n\nBoth child view IDs have the prefix `myContainerView--`:\n\n`myContainerView--ButtonView1` \n\n`myContainerView--ButtonView2` \n\nTo get one of the child views, use the following code: [Essentials](essentials-ec699e0.md)\n\n```js\n...\nvar oButtonView1 = oView.byId(\"ButtonView1\");\n...\n```\n\nThe button view has the following IDs:\n\n`ButtonView1--aButton` \n\n`ButtonView2--aButton` \n\nTo get the button control, use the following code:\n\n```js\n...\n   var oButton = oButtonView1.byId(\"aButton\");\n...\n```\n\n",
