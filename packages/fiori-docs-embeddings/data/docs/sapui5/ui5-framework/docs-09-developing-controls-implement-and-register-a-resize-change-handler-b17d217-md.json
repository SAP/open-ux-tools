Register the change type for this action in the `<control>.flexibility.js` file. For more information, see [Registering Change Handlers for UI Changes](registering-change-handlers-for-ui-changes-d5f4de8.md).\n\nThe resize action also supports handler functions to create changes - similar to *settings* - which returns a promise with an array of objects including change-specific data. See more details in the next section.\n\n",
