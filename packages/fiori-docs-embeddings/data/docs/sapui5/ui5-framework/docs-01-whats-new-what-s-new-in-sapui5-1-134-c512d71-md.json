The `design` property handles the control’s container styling and we strongly recommend setting it to `Plain` in Overlay Mode.

The `uploadProgress` event provides the progress details of a file upload. The `uploadTerminated` event notifies if a file upload has been terminated.\n\nWe’ve also introduced the `terminateUpload` public API to terminate an ongoing file upload.
