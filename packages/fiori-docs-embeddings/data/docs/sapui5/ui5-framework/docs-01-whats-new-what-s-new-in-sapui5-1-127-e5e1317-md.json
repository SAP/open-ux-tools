Now, if an action doesn't have a side effect annotation and the service supports state messages, the system implicitly reads the state messages. For performance optimization, SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 no longer fetches unnecessary data. As a result, it's possible that the required data for an action is no longer executed if you haven't annotated the corresponding side effect.\n\nSAP Fiori elements for OData V4 always aims to read only the required data. If applications want data to be refreshed after a change made by a user, or by calling an action, they must define a side effect. With this change, SAP Fiori elements no longer implicitly reads the full instance after the execution of an action. Instead, SAP Fiori elements relies on the definition of side effects.\n\n> ### Example:  \n> Your app contains an action that results in a status change on the UI, such as the delivery status of an item changing from *Sent* to *Delivered*.\n> \n> Until now the status changed automatically, because all app data was loaded. Now, if the UI requires any other side effects, you must ensure that a side effect annotation exists for the action.\n\n<sub>Changed•SAP Fiori Elements•Recommended•1.127</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nRecommended\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2024-08-08\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.127 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField, sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField, sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`**\n\nFrom now on, if a field has both an `isFiscal*` annotation \\(`IsFiscalYear`, `IsFiscalPeriod`, `IsFiscalYearPeriod`, `IsFiscalQuarter`, `IsFiscalYearQuarter`, `IsFiscalWeek`, or `IsFiscalYearWeek`\\) and the `isDigitSequence` annotation, the `isFiscal*` annotation takes precedence.\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.127</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2024-08-08\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.127 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.filterbar.FilterBar, sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.filterbar.FilterBar, sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`**\n\nFilter bar and smart filter bar now support SAP Companion.
