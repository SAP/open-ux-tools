You can customize the sets of variables and functions that are visible in the calculation builder and introduce your own custom functions. Arithmetic expressions can be entered using a touch-friendly visual editor or a textual editor that provides autocomplete suggestions for variables and checks the expression syntax as you type.\n\n![Calculation Builder](../01_Whats-New/images/Suite_Calculation_Builder_0eb83de.png)\n\nFor more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.commons.CalculationBuilder) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.CalculationBuilder).\n\n",
