Let's say a `RadioButton` control uses a `Label` control internally to present label functionality. Should the `RadioButton` control enable the *rename* action, or is it sufficient that the `Label` control enables it?\n\nHere's the general guidance:\n\n-   The action should be enabled by the plain control if it relies on the control itself, without changing the parent aggregation.\n\n-   If the parent aggregation of the plain control is affected by the action, then the composite control should be enabled for the corresponding action.\n\n-   If the inner control needs to behave differently within the context of a composite control, the design-time metadata/action should be propagated from the composite control to the inner control.\n\n\n",
