When working with SAPUI5, we recommend using the \"module return value\".\n\n> ### Note:  \n> It is best practice to avoid the usage of global names. For more information, see [Best Practices for Developers](../03_Get-Started/best-practices-for-developers-28fcd55.md).\n\nIf you want to export the \"module value\" of an AMD module under a global name, you can rely on the SAPUI5 methods that already do the exposure as a side effect, such as:\n\n-   Classes created by the `extend` method\n\n-   Renderers that are created with `sap/ui/core/Renderer.extend(\"â€¦\")`\n\n\nIn control and class modules, you should not use global variables at all. When you derive a custom control from an existing superclass via the `extend` method, the resulting subclass is returned.\n\nYou can store the return value of the extend function in a local variable, make changes to the prototype and then return this variable as the module's return value.\n\nJSDoc for the class should use the `@alias` tag to make sure that the variable is known under the global name in the generated JSDoc.\n\nThe `extend` function makes sure that the respective namespace is created:\n\n```js\nsap.ui.define([\"sap/ui/base/Object\"], function(BaseObject) {\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor for a new MyClass instance.\n     *\n     * @class\n     * Description for MyClass\n     * @extends sap.ui.base.Object\n     * @alias foo.bar.MyClass\n     */  \n    const Foo = BaseObject.extend(\"foo.bar.MyClass\", /** @lends foo.bar.MyClass.prototype */ {\n      constructor: function() {\n      }\n    });\n\n    Foo.prototype.ownMethod = function(a) {\n        return a * 2;\n    };\n\n    // return the module value, in this example a class\n    return Foo;\n});\n```\n\n",
