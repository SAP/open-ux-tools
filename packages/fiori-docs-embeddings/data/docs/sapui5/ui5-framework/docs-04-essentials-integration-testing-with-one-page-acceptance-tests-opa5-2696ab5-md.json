It hides asynchronicity and eases access to SAPUI5 elements. This makes OPA especially helpful for testing user interactions, integration with SAPUI5, navigation, and data binding.\n\nThe OPA5 library is JavaScript-based. This means that you can write your tests in the same language in which your app is written. This has the following advantages:\n\n-   Quick and easy access to JavaScript functions\n\n-   Easy ramp-up as it can be used with any JavaScript unit test framework, such as QUnit or Jasmine\n\n-   Using the same runtime enables debugging\n\n-   Good SAPUI5 integration\n\n-   Feedback within seconds makes it possible to execute tests directly after a change\n\n-   Asynchronicity is handled with polling instead of timeouts, which makes it faster\n\n-   Enables test-driven development \\(TDD\\)\n\n\nDevelopers write OPA tests during app development. The test-driven development \\(TDD\\) results in less fragile tests, because the app is better isolated and supports less fragile APIs for testing:\n\n-   It follows the arrange act assert pattern \\(corresponds to given when then\\), which improves readability and understanding of the test cases.\n\n-   It is easy to run on mobile devices as no plugins/apps are needed; you can as easily just run it in the browser.\n\n-   Saves time for the developer as regressions decrease\n\n\nIn short: Writing acceptance tests with OPA5 is very easy â€“ Give it a try!\n\n\n\n## Restrictions of OPA5\n\nNote the following restrictions of OPA:\n\n-   Screen capturing\n-   Testing across more than one page\n-   Remote test execution\n-   End-to-end tests are not recommended with OPA due to authentication issues and fragility of test data\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Browser and Platform Support](../02_Read-Me-First/browser-and-platform-support-74b59ef.md \"Here you can find information on the browser and platform support for the SAPUI5 libraries on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows platforms.\")\n\n",
