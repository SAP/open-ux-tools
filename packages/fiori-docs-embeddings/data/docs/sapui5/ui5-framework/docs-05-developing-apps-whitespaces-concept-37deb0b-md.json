Their handling is delegated to the CSS because they are considered to have a formatting value. The reasoning and browser handling are described in detail here: [White Space and Wrapping](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#white-space-property).\n\nHowever, there might be cases when whitespaces can be meaningful for the HTML document. There are several options for handling such cases:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nSolution\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nThings to consider\n\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nUse HTML entities. For more information, see: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity).\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nHTML entities do not work in inputs. Also, they are usually escaped by sanitizers and are rendered as strings. For example, `&nbsp;`.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nUse the CSS's `white-space` property to format texts where needed.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nThe CSS's `white-space` property could have already been used for some special formatting, for example, for text truncation, and you might not be able to reuse it.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nUse Unicode characters to display spaces.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nUnicode characters are displayed well in texts and inputs, however, they are Unicode characters and this could have an impact on the data.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nAs you can see, there's no single fit solution for all the scenarios, but you can use a mix to achieve the desired behavior.\n\nFor HTML inputs, you don't have to do anything. The whitespaces are rendered properly there.\n\nFor text display controls, you could use either the `white-space` CSS property, or Unicode characters.\n\nIn terms of SAPUI5, you would need to use formatters to display whitespaces in your applications. Here's a sample page where you can see how it's used for different controls: For more information, see the [Sample for `sap.m.WhitespacePattern`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.WhitespacePattern). \n\n",
