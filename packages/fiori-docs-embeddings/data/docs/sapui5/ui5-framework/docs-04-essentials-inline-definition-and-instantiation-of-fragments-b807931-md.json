However, instead of the \"fragmentName\" the \"fragmentContent\" needs to be given. This feature can both be used for prototyping or for dynamic fragment composition or for loading fragment content from sources which are not accessible by the normal module loading mechanism. In general, inline definition of fragments plays only a minor role.\n\nJS fragment definitions can be done both inline and within a separate file without any changes. An example inline definition of an XML fragment is given below:\n\n\n\n## Example of an Inline XML Fragment\n\n```xml\n// define the XML fragment as a string (or load it from anywhere)\nvar myXml = '<Panel xmlns=\"sap.m\" text=\"Hello World\"><Button text=\"Hello World\"></Button></Panel>';\n\n// use this XML string as \"fragmentContent\"\nsap.ui.require([\"sap/ui/core/Fragment\"], function(Fragment){\n    Fragment.load({\n        type: \"XML\",\n        definition: myXml\n    }).then(function(oFragment){\n        // put the Fragment content into the document\n        oFragment.placeAt('content');\n    });\n});\n```\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Programmatically Instantiating JS Fragments](programmatically-instantiating-js-fragments-3cff5d0.md \"For each fragment type, SAPUI5 provides a method that can be used to programmatically instantiate a fragment.\")\n\n",
