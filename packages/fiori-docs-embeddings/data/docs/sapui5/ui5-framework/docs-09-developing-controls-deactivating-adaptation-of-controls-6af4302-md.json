There are two options to do so:\n\n-   Overwrite with `null` value \\(soft\\)\n\n    Overwrites all actions for all other controls with `null` values. No actions are available for adaptation, but the controls are still adaptable. They can have property changes or other technical change handlers, like `addXML`.\n\n    ```\n    ... propagateMetadata: function() { return { actions: null } } ...\n    ```\n\n-   Overwrite with `not-adaptable` value \\(hard\\)\n\n    Overwrites all actions for all other controls with `null` values and determines that the control is not adaptable \\(not editable\\). Also, no property changes and other technical change handlers are possible.\n\n    ```\n    ... propagateMetadata: function() { return { actions: \"not-adaptable\" } } ...\n    ```\n\n\nYou can also deactivate adaptation for a particular instance with instance-specific control design-time metadata. For more information, see [Instance-Specific Design-Time Metadata](instance-specific-design-time-metadata-8fa2324.md).\n\n",
