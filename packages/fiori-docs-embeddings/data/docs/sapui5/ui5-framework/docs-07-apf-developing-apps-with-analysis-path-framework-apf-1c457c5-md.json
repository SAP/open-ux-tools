Each step can have its own OData service so that you can define cross-scenarios that use data from different application areas or systems.\n\n    -   Supported data sources for the OData services:\n\n        -   Calculation views\n\n        -   ABAP CDS views\n        -   BW OData queries\n\n\n-   APF Configuration Modeler:\n\n    -   Enables you to create your own APF-based applications in a very quick and easy way and to enhance shipped applications.\n\n    -   Configure an APF-based app without having to code:\n\n        -   Choose from predefined UI elements, such as chart types, tables, and filters. APF takes care of the interaction between these UI elements.\n\n        -   Assign OData services to analysis steps or filters, for example. APF then takes care of the OData request handling, such as when a request is triggered and how it is parameterized.\n\n\n    -   Execute APF-based applications directly from the APF Configuration Modeler using the generic runtime application provided by APF.\n\n    -   In SAP S/4HANA, the APF Configuration Modeler provides in-app help to get context-sensitive user assistance for individual entry fields.\n\n\n-   Integration\n\n    -   Integration with SAP Fiori and SAP Smart Business, which allows you to launch APF-based applications from different tiles or other apps, handing over filters and parameters to the APF-based application.\n    -   Navigation from APF-based applications to other apps, for example, to view additional information or to take action in a transactional app, handing over filters and parameters of the APF-based application to the target application.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about APF-based apps and how to configure them, see the following sections:\n\n\n\n![](images/Image_Map_APF_Overview_4db50b8.png)\n\nIf you need more technical background information, see the following sections:\n\n\n\n![](images/Image_Map_APF_Background_Information_c8a2f56.png)\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/x/lCe7Gg](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/x/lCe7Gg)\n\n",
