Select the one that meets the requirements of your projects and your expectations best.\n\n\n\n## Leverage UI5 Tooling\n\n[UI5 Tooling](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/) complements the framework as an open and modular toolchain. It comes with a [command line interface \\(CLI\\)](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/CLI/) based on Node.js and npm.\n\nFor an application project which has not been enabled yet for UI5 Tooling, follow the concise [Getting Started](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/GettingStarted/) documentation for initial project setup.\n\nThe [OpenUI5 sample application](https://github.com/SAP/openui5-sample-app#openui5-sample-app), available on GitHub, shows typical development steps in your application project. The full set of commands can be seen in the [CLI](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/CLI/#commands) documentation.\n\n[Consuming SAPUI5 libraries](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/SAPUI5/) is made easy when leveraging the UI5 Tooling. It allows for automatically downloading all required framework dependencies of a project.\n\n\n\n## Using a Content Delivery Network\n\nIf you don't want to download the files and don't want to include them in your deployment, you can use the online version of OpenUI5 or SAPUI5 . For more information, see [Variant for Bootstrapping from Content Delivery Network](../04_Essentials/variant-for-bootstrapping-from-content-delivery-network-2d3eb2f.md).\n\n",
