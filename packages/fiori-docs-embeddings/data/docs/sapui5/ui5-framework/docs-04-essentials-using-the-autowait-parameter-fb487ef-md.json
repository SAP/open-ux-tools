It is a good practice to enable it in your tests. By default, it is not enabled in order to keep old tests running.\n\n`autoWait` synchronizes test execution with the app. No interactions are attempted while the app is performing asynchronous work. This increases the probability that OPA statements succeed as they are only executed when the app is ready to respond.\n\n`autoWait` is used:\n\n-   When you retrieve a control with the intent to perform an action on it\n\n-   For every control search, when you explicitly set `autoWait` to `true`\n\n\n`autoWait` is applied before searching for a control, which means before OPA check functions and matchers. If there is no work to await, the controls are retrieved, then actions are executed on them and lastly the success function is called. If there is still pending work, matchers, actions, and success function are skipped and OPA retries the check until it succeeds or a timeout is reached.\n\nSuccess functions are only called when controls are found, their state is valid and the app is responsive. We recommend that you use actions rather than the success function when interacting with a control. This ensures that the interaction is performed properly and the app is in a state that allows the interaction to be executed.\n\n`autoWait` covers several types of asynchronous work:\n\n-   Delayed work set with timeout and immediate\n-   XHR requests created using XMLHttpRequests and sinon.FakeXMLHttpRequests\n-   Native promises created with `resolve`, `all`, `race`, and `reject` functions\n-   UI navigation of parent containers\n-   UIArea rerendering\n\nEnabling `autoWait` ensures that the controls and their parents are visible, enabled and not busy and also that the controls are not hidden behind static elements, such as dialogs.\n\nIf your app has ongoing asynchronous work when the OPA timeout is reached, the test fails. The test failure message includes details of the last detected work before the timeout. This type of OPA timeouts is usually caused by test instability. When writing a huge set of tests and executing them frequently, you might notice some tests that fail sporadically. Setting `autoWait` to `true` should stabilize most of these tests.\n\nIf you decide to follow the best practices and to enable `autoWait`, we recommend that you do it only once in your code, near the starting point of your tests. You can then disable it per `waitFor` statement where needed. This will help you to avoid confusion when debugging test failures.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n// in QUnit start page, before all OPA tests\nOpa5.extendConfig({\n    autoWait: true\n});\n// in an OPA test\noOpa.waitFor({\n    id: \"myControlID\",\n    success: function (oControl) {\n        Opa5.assert.ok(!oControl.getBusy(), \"My control was not busy\");\n    }\n});\n// and then in a special waitFor case which requires a control to be non-interactable\noOpa.waitFor({\n    autoWait: false,\n    id: \"myControlID\",\n    success: function (oControl) {\n        // now you can explicitly check for some blocking condition\n        Opa5.assert.ok(oControl.getBusy(), \"My control was busy\");\n    }\n})\n```\n\nIf you decide to start using `autoWait` in your existing tests, the easiest way to migrate is to extend OPA config by enabling `autoWait`, run the tests to see if any `waitFor` statements timeout and then disable `autoWait` specifically for them.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiofb487ef0f9bf41a3afdbd0cc97368873__section_efn_nnn_2cb\"/>\n\n## `autoWait` and App Startup\n\nUsually, there is a lot of time-consuming work done on app startup which can make the entire app noninteractive for a long time.\n\nTo ensure that OPA doesn't timeout before the app is fully loaded, the timeout for `iStartMyAppInAFrame` and `iStartMyUIComponent` is increased to the default of 80 seconds.\n\nDespite the increase, there are still some tests that timeout. The timeout usually occurs during the first test step, which can be misleading regarding the actual cause of failure. `autoWait` is recommended in such cases but it is disabled during startup to prevent issues with module loading during app launcher initialization.\n\nAs of version 1.54, the optional use of `autoWait` after launcher initialization is allowed to make sure that the app is loaded before the first test step. It is disabled by default for backward compatibility as some tests check for busy indicators on app start. You can use the option with both app launchers, for example:\n\n```js\nGiven.iStartMyAppInAFrame({\n    source: \"applicationUnderTest/index.html\",\n    autoWait: true\n});\n```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiofb487ef0f9bf41a3afdbd0cc97368873__section_ozc_m43_1gb\"/>\n\n## `AutoWait` and Overflow Toolbars\n\nUnder some specific circumstances, the `autoWait` is not waiting enough time and the next interaction happens before the awaited controls are fully rendered. This problem is particularly visible with overflow toolbars as the interaction with buttons in the toolbar happens before it is completely open and the included buttons are not yet ready, meaning that the interactions are lost.\n\nThe root cause is a specific behavior in OPA polling when a control is found on first check. In this case, the next check\\(\\) is synchronous, for example, it is executed immediately and not on the next poll interval. The problem with this implementation is that the synchronous check prevents the detection of subsequent flows started by the previous interaction. As a result, the synchronization is premature as it happens before the interaction is fully processed and before the UI is completely rendered.\n\nAs of version 1.54, there is an `asyncPolling` parameter that overcomes this problem. It causes a postponement of the check\\(\\) in the next polling and gives a chance for the execution flows caused by the interaction to complete. Unfortunately, it is not possible to make this behavior as default as there are many tests that are coded against the old behavior.\n\nThe suggested approach is to set `asyncPolling` as default for all `waitFor` statements:\n\n```js\n// in QUnit start page, before all OPA tests\nOpa5.extendConfig({\n    autoWait: true,\n    asyncPolling: true\n});\n```\n\nSetting `asyncPolling` on existing tests may cause a failure because of the more strict synchronization. The most common uncovered problem is a test that is dependent on premature synchronization, such as an assertion for table rows that is executed before the table is fully loaded.\n\nSame parameter can be set for individual `waitFor` statements:\n\n```js\n// in an OPA test\noOpa.waitFor({\n    id: \"controlId\",\n    asyncPolling: true,\n    success: function (oControl) {\n        // TODO assert status\n    }\n});\n```\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Pitfalls and Troubleshooting](pitfalls-and-troubleshooting-698f8c0.md \"Tips and tricks if OPA isn't behaving or reacting the way you expect it to.\")\n\n[API Reference: `sap.ui.test.Opa5`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.test.Opa5)\n\n[Samples: `sap.ui.test.Opa5`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.test.Opa5)\n\n",
