An expansion state can be provided via the `expandTo` property of either the `$$aggregation` binding parameter or the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#setAggregation` API.\n\n    For more information, see the API Reference for [`v4.Context#move`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/move), [`v4.ODataModel#bindList`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23methods/bindList), and [`v4.ODataListBinding#setAggregation`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding%23methods/setAggregation).\n\n-   If you move a node with the experimental `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#move` API and the moved node has siblings, it is now shown by default at a position assigned by the back end. Alternatively, you now have the option of moving the node to a position before a specified sibling or to the last position among its siblings.\n\n    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/move).\n\n-   The tree state is now kept when sorting or filtering a recursive hierarchy.\n\n-   We have introduced the new `$$clearSelectionOnFilter` list binding parameter. When a filter or search is changed, it allows you to automatically deselect records that were selected via the experimental `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#setSelected` API.\n\n    For more information, see the API Reference for [`v4.ODataModel#bindList`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23methods/bindList) and [`v4.Context#setSelected`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/setSelected).\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.124</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2024-05-16\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.124 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Spreadsheet Export** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Spreadsheet Export**\n\nYou can now use the `preventDefault` method to stop the export process for entities that have a `beforeExport` event without retrieving any data or generating an export file.
