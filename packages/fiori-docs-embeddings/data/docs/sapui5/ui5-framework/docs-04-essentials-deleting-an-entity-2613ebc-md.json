If the request fails, or the deletion is canceled via [`ODataModel#resetChanges`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23methods/resetChanges), [`ODataListBinding#resetChanges`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding%23methods/resetChanges), or [`v4.Context#resetChanges`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/resetChanges), the row is re-inserted.\n\nBound messages targeting the entity, one of its properties, or its navigation properties, are also removed immediately; this applies to both state and transition messages. If you cancel the deletion, these messages are restored. If the deletion fails, only the state messages are restored; the transition messages are dropped to make room for new transition messages resulting from the failed deletion.\n\nAs soon as a context is deleted on the client, [`#isDeleted`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/isDeleted) returns `true` and the context must not be used anymore \\(except by status APIs like [`#isDeleted`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/isDeleted), `#isKeepAlive`, `#hasPendingChanges`, `#resetChanges`\\). If the context is used as a binding context of a control or view, be sure to unbind it using `setBindingContext(null)`. If the context is restored due to a failure or reset, you might want to rebind this control or view again.\n\nOnce the entity is finally deleted on the server \\(i.e. the promise of `#delete` is resolved\\), no method of the context may be used anymore.\n\n**Example: Delete from a table with an object page**\n\n```js\nonDeleteSalesOrder : function () {\n    var oTable = this.getView().byId(\"SalesOrders\"),\n        oSalesOrderContext = oTable.getSelectedItem().getBindingContext(),\n        oObjectPage = this.getView().byID(\"objectPage\");\n\n    if (oObjectPage.getBindingContext() === oSalesOrderContext) {\n        oObjectPage.setBindingContext(null);\n    }\n    oSalesOrderContext.delete().then(function () {\n        MessageBox.alert(\"Deleted Sales Order\",\n            {icon : MessageBox.Icon.SUCCESS, title : \"Success\"});\n    }, function (oError) {\n        if (oSalesOrderContext === that.oLastSelectedSalesOrderContext) {\n            oObjectPage.setBindingContext(oSalesOrderContext);\n        }\n        MessageBox.alert(\"Could not delete Sales Order: \"\n            + oError.message, {icon : MessageBox.Icon.ERROR, title : \"Error\"});\n    });\n},\n```\n\nYou can also delete an entity from the model and all its bindings via [`v4.ODataModel#delete`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23methods/delete) using a canonical binding path to the entity. The model then sends a `DELETE` request to the server. If this request succeeds, the entity is removed from all its bindings. The conditions for identifying these bindings are described in the API documentation.\n\n> ### Caution:  \n> Be cautious if your control or view uses a binding with an empty path \\(`<Page id=\"entityDetails\" binding=\"{}\">`\\) and you want to delete the entity it displays. The context you get via `oView.byId(\"entityDetails\").getBindingContext()` can be used to delete this entity, but calling `delete()` immediately makes the context binding unresolved and destroys the context. The same holds true if you call `oView.byId(\"entityDetails\").setBindingContext(null)` to clear the control or view. This makes it impossible to restore the control or view in case of failure.\n> \n> Using context bindings with an empty path is deprecated and should be avoided if possible. Consider setting up your views as described in [Data Reuse](data-reuse-648e360.md). The binding context of your detail page is then the list's row context, and there will be no issue regarding data sharing or deleting.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Context.delete](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/delete)\n\n",
