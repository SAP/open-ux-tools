The following extension methods are supported:\n\n-   `onBeforeCreate`\n\n    triggered before the standard create method is invoked\n\n-   `onBeforeEdit`\n\n    triggered before the standard edit flow is invoked\n\n-   `onBeforeSave`\n\n    triggered before the standard save method is invoked\n\n-   `onBeforeDiscard`\n\n    triggered before the standard draft discard is invoked\n\n-   `onBeforeDelete`\n\n    triggered before the standard delete method is invoked for an object page, or for each selected table context\n\n\nFor more information about using the extension methods, see the *Related Links* section below.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If you want to use custom code to display messages, use the `securedExecution` method.\n> \n> Also use this method to wrap custom code in case it changes the state of the object. In this case, ensure that the `\"updatesDocument\"` property is set to true so that SAP Fiori elements can display a confirmation popover, allowing users to discard their changes if they try to cancel or navigate away from the object.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio877e5ff4e9e243e4a821811b183f8937__section_emm_bgh_fsb\"/>\n\n## Related Links\n\n-   You can explore and work with the coding yourself.
