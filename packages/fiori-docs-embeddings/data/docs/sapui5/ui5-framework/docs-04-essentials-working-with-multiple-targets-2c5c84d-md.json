The targets can still be displayed separately if needed. Use this approach when the connection between the targets is only needed in some routes, but not always.\n\n\n\n## Parent Relationship\n\nYou can also define a parent for a target in the target definition. For the parent, you also create an entry in the `targets` configuration, but you don't have to create a corresponding route.\n\nWhenever a target has a parent, an instance of the parent is always created before an instance of the target is created.\n\nA parent relationship between targets tightly couples the two targets together. The parent target is always displayed before the child target is displayed. The child target can't be displayed without first displaying the parent target. This approach is mainly used when the view in the child target is added to an aggregation of the view in the parent target.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> There is also a `parent` property for the `route`. This property is only used when its parent exists in a parent component of the current component \\(see [Enabling Routing in Nested Components](enabling-routing-in-nested-components-fb19f50.md)\\). For all other types of parent-child relationships, either use multiple targets or a parent relationship in targets.\n\n\n\n## Example\n\nIn the following example, the relationship between the views `employeeOverviewTop` and `employeeOverviewContent` is established by assigning both to the same route.\n\nThe relationship between the target `employeeOverview` and `employeeOverviewTop` \\(`employeeOverviewContent` respectively\\) is a parent relationship.\n\n```js\n\n\"routing\": {\n  \"config\": {\n    path: \"sap.ui.demo.nav.view.employee.overview\",\n    [...]\n  },\n  \"routes\": [{\n    \"pattern\": \"employees/overview\",\n    \"name\": \"employeeOverview\",\n    \"target\": [\"employeeOverviewTop\", \"employeeOverviewContent\"]\n  }],\n  \"targets\": {\n    \"employeeOverview\": {\n      \"type\": \"View\",\n      \"name\": \"EmployeeOverview\",\n      \"level\": 2,\n      \"controlId\": \"app\",\n      \"controlAggregation\": \"content\"\n    },\n    \"employeeOverviewTop\": {\n      \"parent\": \"employeeOverview\",\n      \"type\": \"View\",\n      \"name\": \"EmployeeOverviewTop\",\n      \"controlId\": \"EmployeeOverviewParent\",\n      \"controlAggregation\": \"content\"\n    },\n    \"employeeOverviewContent\": {\n      \"parent\": \"employeeOverview\",\n      \"type\": \"View\",\n      \"name\": \"EmployeeOverviewContent\",\n      \"controlId\": \"EmployeeOverviewParent\",\n      \"controlAggregation\": \"content\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nFor more information, see the tutorial [Step 11: Assign Multiple Targets](../03_Get-Started/step-11-assign-multiple-targets-b01840e.md).\n\n",
