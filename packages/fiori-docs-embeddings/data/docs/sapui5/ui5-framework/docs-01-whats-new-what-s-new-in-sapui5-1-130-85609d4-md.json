For example, if today is 17 October 2024, then `Last 2 Days` would return the interval `15 October 2024 – 16 October 2024`. We have now added additional options and the users also have the choice to include the current period. Therefore, in the same example, the control would return `16 October 2024 – 17 October 2024`.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#api/module:sap/base/i18n/date/CalendarWeekNumbering) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/calendar).\n\n-   We have added a new `use12HourFormat` Boolean property to the Calendar card, which enables developers to display the card either in 24-hour \\(default\\) or 12-hour format.\n\n-   We have improved the UX in the pagination for List, Table, and Timeline cards. Previously, users could flip back and forth through the items of the card in place. Now, they can scroll through the items. Scrolling happens in a separate card, which opens in a dialog after selecting the *Show More* button. For more information, see the [Pagination](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/pagination) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/pagination/server).\n\n-   The Component card now supports file upload functionality. To achieve this, we have enhanced the card’s `request` method to support parameters of type `FormData`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card/methods/request) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/component/uploadFile).\n\n-   We have introduced a new `fitType` property for icons in the Default Header and in the Object card. You can use it to define how the image fits in the icon space. The new property accepts values from the `sap.m.AvatarImageFitType` enum, with the default value `Cover`. For more information, see the [Default Header](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/headers/default) section and the
