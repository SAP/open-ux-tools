To correctly integrate your app extension coding with SAP Fiori elements, use only the `extensionAPI` of SAP Fiori elements. For more information, see [Using the extensionAPI](using-the-extensionapi-bd2994b.md).\n> > \n> > After you've created an app extension, its display \\(for example, control placement and layout\\) and system behavior \\(for example, model and binding usage, busy handling\\) lies within the application's responsibility. SAP Fiori elements provides support only for the official `extensionAPI` functions. Don't access or manipulate controls, properties, models, or other internal objects created by the SAP Fiori elements framework.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio340cdb2ba97c4843979f905a70a327ee__section_llp_frp_znb\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V2\n\nYou can use [SAP Fiori tools](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_FIORI_tools/Latest/en-US), which is a set of extensions for SAP Business Application Studio and Visual Studio Code, to create app extensions.\n\nFor more information on creating app extensions, see:\n\n-   [Configure Page Elements](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/047507c86afa4e96bb3d284adb9f4726.html)\n\n-   [Extending List Reports and Object Pages Using App Extensions](extending-list-reports-and-object-pages-using-app-extensions-a892eb8.md)\n\n-   [Configuring Analytical List Page App Extensions](configuring-analytical-list-page-app-extensions-9504fb4.md)\n\n-   [Configuring Overview Page App Extensions](configuring-overview-page-app-extensions-b240f61.md)\n\n-   [Extending Apps](../08_Extending_SAPUI5_Applications/extending-apps-a264a9a.md)\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio340cdb2ba97c4843979f905a70a327ee__section_lgr_krp_znb\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4\n\nFor information about the `ExtensionAPI`, see [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.fe.core.ExtensionAPI).\n\n",
