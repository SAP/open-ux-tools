The *OK* button enables the user to close the popover in addition to the standard behavior of `sap.m.Popover`.\n\n-   With the `showPersonalization` property you enable the user to add facets to the toolbar by selecting the *Add Facet* icon. Personalization is disabled by default.\n\n-   With the `showSummaryBar` property you can display the active facets as a non-selectable summary bar. You use this property if you preset facet filters and the user is not allowed to change them.\n\n    ![](images/SAPUI5_Facet_Filter_Summary_Bar_53a401c.png)\n\n\n",
