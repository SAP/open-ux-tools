The auto formatter handles many lines and makes it more difficult to find out who actually wrote the code.\n\n\n\n\n## ESLint\n\nSAPUI5 uses ESLint to check JavaScript sources. A recommended set of rules and settings can be found in our [**OpenUI5 project**](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/blob/-/docs/eslint.md).\n\n",
