We use them to format our price according to the current number in the data model.\n\n\n\n## Preview\n\n  \n  \n**The price is now formatted according to its number**\n\n![A list of invoices is displayed below the panel.](images/UI5_Walkthrough_Step_21_636b700.png \"The price is now formatted according to its number\")\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio8d67ba2cc18c484fa529de855596982a__section_uzp_rmk_syb\"/>\n\n## Coding\n\nYou can view all files at [OpenUI5 TypeScript Walkthrough - Step 21: Expression Binding](https://github.com/sap-samples/ui5-typescript-walkthrough/tree/main/steps/21) and [download the solution as a zip file](https://sap-samples.github.io/ui5-typescript-walkthrough/ui5-typescript-walkthrough-step-21.zip).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio8d67ba2cc18c484fa529de855596982a__section_vzp_rmk_syb\"/>\n\n## webapp/view/InvoiceList.view.xml\n\nWe add the `numberState` attribute to the `ObjectListItem` control invoices list view. We use the `=` symbol to initiate an expression binding and specify that the number in `numberState` appears in red if the price is greater than 50, otherwise in green.\n\n```xml\n<mvc:View\n    controllerName=\"ui5.walkthrough.controller.InvoiceList\"\n    xmlns=\"sap.m\"\n    xmlns:core=\"sap.ui.core\"\n    xmlns:mvc=\"sap.ui.core.mvc\">\n    <List\n        headerText=\"{i18n>invoiceListTitle}\"\n        class=\"sapUiResponsiveMargin\"\n        width=\"auto\"\n        items=\"{invoice>/Invoices}\">\n        <items>\n            <ObjectListItem\n                core:require=\"{\n                    Currency: 'sap/ui/model/type/Currency'\n                }\"\n                title=\"{invoice>Quantity} x {invoice>ProductName}\"\n                number=\"{\n                    parts: [\n                        'invoice>ExtendedPrice',\n                        'view>/currency'\n                    ],\n                    type: 'Currency',\n                    formatOptions: {\n                        showMeasure: false\n                    }\n                }\"\n                numberUnit=\"{view>/currency}\"\n                numberState=\"{= ${invoice>ExtendedPrice} > 50 ? 'Error' : 'Success' }\"/>\n        </items>\n    </List>\n</mvc:View>\n```\n\nExpression binding can do simple calculation logic like the ternary operator shown here.\n\nThe condition of the operator is a value from our data model. A model binding inside an expression binding has to be escaped with the `$` sign as you can see in the code. We set the state to \"Error\" \\(the number will appear in red\\) if the price is higher than 50 and to \"Success\" \\(the number will appear in green\\) otherwise.\n\nExpressions are limited to a particular set of operations that help formatting the data such as Math expression, comparisons, and such. You can look up the possible operations in the [documentation](../04_Essentials/expression-binding-daf6852.md).\n\n\n\n## Conventions\n\n-   Only use expression binding for trivial calculations.\n\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Expression Binding](../04_Essentials/expression-binding-daf6852.md \"Expression binding is an enhancement of the SAPUI5 binding syntax, which allows for providing expressions instead of custom formatter functions.\")\n\n",
