Some advantages of SAP Business Application Studio:\n\n-   Uses Git for version control of the sources\n\n-   Supports a client-side build that generates minified files and packages preload bundles to optimize start-up performance\n\n-   Pushes the SAP Business Application Studio state to the ABAP system in a one-way, overwrite-all operation\n\n\nDon't manually edit the BSP application representing a single SAPUI5 repository.\n\nThe SAPUI5 ABAP repository supports typical code pages for transferring of text files. However, there are some code pages that are not supported, for example code page `CP932` containing Japanese characters. If in doubt, we recommend that you encode the files transferred to the SAPUI5 ABAP repository in `UTF-8`.\n\n**Related Links**\n\n-   [SAP Business Application Studio](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP%2520Business%2520Application%2520Studio/Cloud/en-US)\n\n-   [Deploying SAPUI5 Applications to the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository](deploying-sapui5-applications-to-the-sapui5-abap-repository-a560bd6.md)\n\n-   [Using an OData Service to Load Data to the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository](using-an-odata-service-to-load-data-to-the-sapui5-abap-repository-a883327.md)\n\n",
