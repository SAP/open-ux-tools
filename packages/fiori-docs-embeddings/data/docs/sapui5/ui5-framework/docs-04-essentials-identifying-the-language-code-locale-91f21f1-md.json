Examples are `de`, `en-US`, `zh-Hans-CN`.\n\n-   Java locale syntax that combines a lower case ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code with an ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code\n\n    Both codes are combined with an underscore. An arbitrary sequence of variant identifiers \\(also separated by underscores\\) can be appended as a third component. Examples are `de`, `en_US`, `zh_TW_Traditional` \n\n-   SAP proprietary language codes \\(only supported by URL parameter `sap-language`\\)\n\n    SAPUI5 applications are often used to connect to ABAP-based SAP application servers. These servers use SAP proprietary language codes for compatibility reasons. These language codes often match an ISO 639 alpha-2 language code, but not in all cases. If the language code for an SAPUI5 application is specified with the URL parameter `sap-language`, SAPUI5 assumes that it is an SAP proprietary language code and converts it to a BCP-47 language tag as follows:\n\n\n    <table>\n    <tr>\n    <th valign=\"top\">\n\n    SAP Language Code\n    \n    </th>\n    <th valign=\"top\">\n\n    BCP 47 Language Tag\n    \n    </th>\n    <th valign=\"top\">\n\n    Description\n    \n    </th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n    \n    `ZH`\n    \n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n    \n    `zh-Hans`\n    \n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n    \n    `ZH` is the SAP language code for Simplified Chinese.

Other SAP-proprietary language codes are not automatically transformed. If you develop your app to run in the SAP Fiori launchpad, all other SAP-proprietary language codes are handled by the SAP Fiori launchpad.\n    > \n    > If you don't make use of the SAP Fiori launchpad, you may have to explicitly implement the language handling. You can use the `sap/base/i18n/Localization.setLanguage()` method to provide both settings, a BCP 47 language code and the corresponding SAP-proprietary language, in one call. SAPUI5 will then use one of the two codes where appropriate \\(e.g. BCP 47 for the retrieval of translated texts or in HTTP Accept Headers, but the proprietary SAP language code when propagating the `sap-language` URL parameter to an OData service\\).\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio91f21f176f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_6CAF7D95C27C487CB201CE83345AC370\"/>\n\n## Current Language Code / Locale\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The `lang` attribute for the current language is set at page level for the entire page. If a page contains text that is not in the current language \\(for example, French elements on an English page\\), this text cannot be labeled with a different language tag. SAPUI5 doesn't offer dedicated support to mark application parts, sections, etc. that are in a different language.\n> \n> Depending on the use case, application developers can alternatively use techniques like directly defining the HTML with the `sap.ui.core.HTML` control and set the `lang` attribute accordingly. Another alternative could be iFrame isolation.\n\nSAPUI5 has the notion of a current language. It is determined during the SAPUI5 bootstrap from the following sources of information. The sources are ordered increasingly by priority and the last available user language/locale wins:\n\n1.  Hard-coded SAPUI5 default locale `en`\n\n2.  Browser-derived language\n\n3.  `sap-ui-language` configuration parameter \\(consider the order of the [Available Configuration Options](configuration-of-the-sapui5-runtime-91f08de.md#loio91f08de06f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_ACO)\\)\n\n4.  `sap-language` configuration parameter \\(consider the order of the [Available Configuration Options](configuration-of-the-sapui5-runtime-91f08de.md#loio91f08de06f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_ACO)\\)\n\n5.  `sap-locale` configuration parameter \\(consider the order of the [Available Configuration Options](configuration-of-the-sapui5-runtime-91f08de.md#loio91f08de06f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_ACO)\\)\n\n6.  Locale configured in the application coding \\(for more information, see [API Reference: `sap/base/i18n/Localization.setLanguage`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/module:sap/base/i18n/Localization.setLanguage). \\)\n\n    ```js\n        sap.ui.require([\"sap/base/i18n/Localization\"], (Localization) => {\n            // Change the language using the API\n            Localization.setLanguage(...);\n    \t\t\n            // Retrieve the current language\n            const sLanguage = Localization.getLanguage();\n        });\n    ```\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> A call to the [`Localization.setLanguage`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/module:sap/base/i18n/Localization.setLanguage). method does not guarantee that all already existing translatable texts will be adapted.\n> \n> The syntax of the value returned from `getLanguage` depends on the syntax used for configuration. If the information source is one of the browser language properties, the returned language most likely is in BCP-47 format. If it is configured as a URL parameter, the user might have chosen the JDK-locale syntax.\n\n",
