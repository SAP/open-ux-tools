The card supports single-valued `DataField` based columns. It also supports columns with field values displayed as links such as `DataFieldWithUrl`, semantic links, and `DataField` with `QuickViewFacets`. In addition, SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 also supports `DataFieldWithIntentBasedNavigation` and `DataFieldWithNavigationPath` columns.\n> \n> The columns that are not supported by the card creation dialog include:\n> \n> -   Image\n> \n> -   Multi-valued based columns\n> \n> -   `FieldGroup` based columns\n> \n> -   Columns with inline action\n> \n> -   Columns with navigation button\n> \n> -   `DataFieldForAnnotation` based columns \\(for contact or address fields\\)\n> \n> -   Custom columns\n\nApplication developers can hide the *Add Card to Insights* option from the overflow toolbar by configuring specific settings in the `manifest.json` file. For more information, see the version-specific sections of this topic.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio9b13559ef978405a99e8b624a87daf31__section_kbf_fb2_jxb\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V2\n\nUsing the `manifest.json`, list report applications can choose to hide this feature by setting the `addCardtoInsightsHidden` property within `tableSettings` to `true`, as displayed in the following sample code:\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ```\n> \"sap.ui.generic.app\": {\n>     \"pages\": [{\n>         \"entitySet\": \"Zfarvd_Bs_Hd_Bo\",\n>         \"component\": {\n>             \"name\": \"sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ListReport\",\n>             \"list\": true,\n>             \"settings\": {\n>                 \"tableSettings\": { \n>                     \"addCardtoInsightsHidden\": \"true\" //default value false\n>                 }\n>             }\n>         }\n>     }]\n> }\n> ```\n\nSimilarly, using the `manifest.json`, analytical list page applications can choose to hide this feature by setting the `addCardtoInsightsHidden` property within `chartSettings` to `true`, as displayed in the following sample code:\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ```\n> \"sap.ui.generic.app\": {\n>     \"pages\": [{\n>         \"entitySet\": \"Zfarvd_Bs_Hd_Bo\",\n>         \"component\": {\n>             \"name\": \"sap.suite.ui.generic.template.AnalyticalListPage\",\n>             \"list\": true,\n>             \"settings\": {\n>                 \"chartSettings\": { \n>                     \"addCardtoInsightsHidden\": \"true\" //default value false\n>                 }\n>             }\n>         }\n>     }]\n> }\n> ```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio9b13559ef978405a99e8b624a87daf31__section_zbk_2qx_3xb\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The card creation feature only supports single view scenarios and single entity-multi view scenarios with responsive tables in list report applications.\n\nTo hide the *Add Card to Insights* option in the table toolbar, add the following settings into the `manifest.json` file:\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ```\n> \"controlConfiguration\": {\n>      \"@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem\": {\n>          \"tableSettings\": {\n>              \"type\": \"ResponsiveTable\",\n>              \"enableAddCardToInsights\": false\n>          }\n>      }\n> }\n> ```\n\nTo hide the *Add Card to Insights* option in the chart toolbar, add the following settings into the `manifest.json` file:\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ```\n> \"controlConfiguration\": {\n>     \"@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Chart\": {\n>         enableAddCardToInsights: false\n>     }\n> }\n> ```\n\n> ### Restriction:  \n> -   When creating an integration card from the list report table, the following changes aren't retained when navigating back from the card:\n> \n>     -   The filter fields or table columns that were removed\n> \n>     -   Changes in the position of filter fields or table columns\n> \n> \n> -   Cards don't have the same formatting for unit of measure fields as seen in the list report table.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[**My Home** in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition ](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/4fc8d03390c342da8a60f8ee387bca1a/8a60279e8d2041b5ad8d3455fab0f3ef.html)\n\n[**My Home** in SAP S/4HANA](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/a7b390faab1140c087b8926571e942b7/8a60279e8d2041b5ad8d3455fab0f3ef.html)\n\n",
