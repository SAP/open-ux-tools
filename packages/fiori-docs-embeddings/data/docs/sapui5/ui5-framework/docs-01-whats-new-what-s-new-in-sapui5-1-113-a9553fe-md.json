Note that the `calendarWeekNumbering` format option introduced with SAPUI5 1.108 for `sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat` overrules the central configuration.\n\n    For more information, see [Configuration Options and URL Parameters](../04_Essentials/configuration-options-and-url-parameters-91f2d03.md).\n\n-   We provide the new `intervalDelimiter` format option for `sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat`. If an `intervalDelimiter` is set, the locale-specific rules for displaying a range as defined in the Common Locale Data Repository are overruled; the two parts of the range are formatted individually, and the given delimiter is used.\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.113</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2023-04-20\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.113 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**\n\nThe new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:\n\n-   You can now delete nested transient records that were created using the experimental Deep Create feature provided with SAPUI5 1.112. Any initial data handed over to `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#create` can now contain nested entities.\n\n    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding/methods/create).\n\n-   In read-only scenarios, you can now combine the experimental hierarchy feature introduced with SAPUI5 1.105 with the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#setKeepAlive` and `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#getKeepAliveContext` data synchronization methods described in [Data Reuse](../04_Essentials/data-reuse-648e360.md).\n\n    For more information, see the API Reference for [`setKeepAlive`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/setKeepAlive) and [`getKeepAliveContext`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/methods/getKeepAliveContext).\n\n-   The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#resetChanges` API introduced as an experimental feature with SAPUI5 1.109 is now generally available.\n\n    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/resetChanges).\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.113</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2023-04-20\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.113 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V2 Model** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V2 Model**\n\nYou can now prevent the activation of a new inactive entity by using `sap.ui.base.Event#preventDefault` in the handler of the `createActivate` event of an `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataListBinding`. Note that user input into inactive rows is regarded as a pending change by `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#hasPendingChanges`; it can be reset using `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#resetChanges`.\n\nFor more information, see the API Reference for [`hasPendingChanges`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel/methods/hasPendingChanges), [`resetChanges`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel/methods/resetChanges), and [`Event.preventDefault`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.base.Event/methods/preventDefault).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.113</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2023-04-20\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.113 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSAP Fiori Elements \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAP Fiori elements for OData V2** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAP Fiori elements for OData V2**\n\nThe following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V2:\n\n-   We now show the subtitle and the app icon in the navigation menu as defined in the application's manifest. For more information, see [Checking Folder Structure and Project Artifacts](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/checking-folder-structure-and-project-artifacts-f7abd1b.md).\n\n-   We've improved the data entry experience in draft-enabled SAP Fiori elements apps to make it less disruptive for users.\n\n    SAP Fiori elements no longer requests state messages with every `MERGE` request, resulting in fewer error messages on the UI. Messages are now fetched when a `GET` request is resolved in the following scenarios:\n\n    -   Validation \\(a user triggers the request using the [Enter\\] key or the *Validate* button\\)\n\n    -   Finalizing actions \\(a user triggers the request using the *Save* or *Create* button\\)\n\n    -   Creation of an object\n\n    -   Update of fields configured with side effects\n\n    -   Update of multi-input fields\n\n\n    This improvement affects `MERGE` requests such as the following use cases:\n\n    -   Update of a draft \\(a user updates data in a field of a draft object\\)\n\n    -   Creation of an item in a table on an object page\n\n    -   Update of data from custom facets or reusable components that are merged via `MERGE` requests from the framework\n\n\n\n<sub>Changed•SAP Fiori Elements•Info Only•1.113</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2023-04-20\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.113 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSAP Fiori Elements \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAP Fiori elements for OData V4** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAP Fiori elements for OData V4**\n\nThe following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4:\n\n-   You can now show and hide tables in object page reference facets.

Note that in SAP Fiori apps that were built using ABAP CDS, sort restrictions may apply.\n\n    ![](images/Sorting_Column_Content_-_Improved_68e1849.png)\n\n-   When no `QuickView` annotations are defined and no target is resolved at runtime, the field now appears as a link and a message is displayed when you click the link.

Before this change, states like `Error`, `Warning`, `Success`, or `Information`, only had default icons. For more information, see the [Table Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/table) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/table/visibleColumns) in the Card Explorer.\n\n-   Integration cards now support the `IllustratedMessage` control to provide more informative and consistent error messages. When the application is in debug mode \\(when the URL parameter `sap-ui-debug=true` is set\\), the *Show More* button opens a dialog with relevant additional \\(more technical\\) information.\n\n-   We have enhanced the Table card with several new properties:\n\n    -   You can use the new `highlight` property to show the state of each table row. Additionally, the `highlightText` property conveys the semantic of this state for better accessibility.\n    -   The `additionalText` property gives you the option to display additional text in the table identifier column.\n\n    For more information, see the [Table Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/table) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/table/highlight) in the Card Explorer. \n\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.113</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2023-04-20\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.113 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`**\n\n-   The control now supports the `Common.IsTimezone` annotation that indicates whether a given property of type `Edm.String` is a time zone.\n\n-   We have enhanced the support of the `FieldControl` annotation `<Annotation Term=\"Common.FieldControl\" EnumMember=\"Common.FieldControlType/Optional\"/>`. Because its default value is `Optional` and that's why it usually isn't explicitly defined by the services. Until now, this behavior was controlled by the property\\`s `Nullable` annotation \\(`Nullable=false` was regarded as mandatory\\). Now we respect this enum member, whenever it\\`s defined, and in cases when there is a `FieldControl` annotation defined with value `Optional`, we take it into account and do not indicate the field as mandatory.\n\n\nFor more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField). \n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.113</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2023-04-20\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.113 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField` and `sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField` and `sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`**\n\nThese controls now support the `inputFieldSuggestions` setting from SAP Fiori launchpad.
