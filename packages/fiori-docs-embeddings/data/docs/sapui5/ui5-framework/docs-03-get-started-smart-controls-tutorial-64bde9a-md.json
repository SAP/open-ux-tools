In some cases, a smart control even persists an adapted version of the user interface that the user has defined for later usage.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The controls in this library only support OData V2 and a default model \\(named `undefined`\\). \n\nIn this tutorial, you see examples that should make the term \"smart\" even more tangible.\n\n> ### Tip:  \n> You don't have to do all tutorial steps sequentially, you can also jump directly to any step you want. Just download the code from the previous step, copy it to your workspace and make sure that the application runs by calling the `webapp/index.html` file.\n> \n> You can view and download the files for all steps in the *Samples* in the Demo Kit at [Smart Controls](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.tutorial.smartControls). Depending on your development environment you might have to adjust resource paths and configuration entries.\n> \n> For more information check the [Downloading Code for a Tutorial Step](get-started-setup-tutorials-and-demo-apps-8b49fc1.md#loio8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218__tutorials_download) section of the tutorials overview page [Get Started: Setup, Tutorials, and Demo Apps](get-started-setup-tutorials-and-demo-apps-8b49fc1.md).\n\n",
