You can change this decimal padding for your app. To do so, use the dedicated manifest keys `currency` and `unitOfMeasure` as shown in the following sample code:\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> `manifest.json`\n> \n> ```\n> \"sap.fe\": {\n>     \"macros\": {\n>         \"table\": {\n>             \"currency\": {\n>                 \"decimalPadding\": 5\n>             },\n>             \"unitOfMeasure\": {\n>                 \"decimalPadding\": 3\n>             }\n>         }\n>     }\n> }\n> ```\n\n",
