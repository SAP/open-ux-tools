This hybrid view allows an interesting interplay between the chart and table representations.\n\nConfigure the ALP to include the following use cases seamlessly on one page:\n\n-   Related KPIs on the header area as KPI tags. These KPI tags also allow progressive disclosure and navigation through KPI cards.\n-   Filter data sets used for the main content area with different filter modes. For example, visual filters provide an intuitive way of choosing filter values from an associated measure value.\n-   Seamless navigation to applications from the content area and the KPI card area.\n-   Customizing and sharing ALP as a page variant with other users.\n\n\n\n![](images/ALP_Screenshot_182e040.png)\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio3d33684b08ca4490b26a844b6ce19b83__section_qnb_bwc_1qb\"/>\n\n## Restrictions for SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4\n\nVisual filters are supported with restrictions.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio3d33684b08ca4490b26a844b6ce19b83__section_ikr_k1v_r1b\"/>\n\n## More Information\n\nFor more information about the analytical list page, see [Building an App](building-an-app-9834a0a.md).\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Descriptor Configuration for the Analytical List Page](descriptor-configuration-for-the-analytical-list-page-2a9df06.md \"The descriptor file (manifest.json) is an application configuration file that contains valid entries for initializing the analytical list page (ALP).\")\n\n[Configuring the Title Area](configuring-the-title-area-ebdb5da.md \"The dynamic area of the analytical list page is the title area.\")\n\n[Configuring the Visual Filter Bar](configuring-the-visual-filter-bar-33f3d80.md \"The visual filter bar enables end users to select filter values based on measure values in addition to the filters and filter values already selected in the regular filter bar.\")\n\n[Configuring the Content Area](configuring-the-content-area-fc7d73c.md \"Visualize data from the main entity set and seamlessly navigate to an application.
