It's only called once if multiple changes of the same type were applied on the same control.\n\nThis hook can be used for performance improvements. Example: Data is retrieved and used by more than one change handler. To prevent multiple superfluous calls to the data source, the data is stored in the XML tree as custom data . The `onAfterXMLChangeProcessing` hook is then used to remove the custom data before the view-cache is created from the XML tree.\n\n",
