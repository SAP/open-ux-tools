Due to inheritance, your implementation would overwrite the implementation of the superclass.\n\n-   Names starting with `set...`/`get...`/`insert...`/`add...`/`remove...`/`indexOf...`/`destroy...` shall not be used because they may collide with setters/getters for properties or aggregations that are defined explicitely or by a superclass.\n\n-   Names starting with `attach...`/`detach...`/`fire` may collide with methods created for events.\n\n\nThe following method names have a specific meaning and should be used accordingly:\n\n-   `on...`: Used for event handlers that are automatically bound to browser events\n\n-   `init`: Used for the initialization function that is called after control instantiation\n\n-   `renderer`: Used for the function that creates the control's HTML\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Any method in your inheriting control overrides methods with the same name in the superclass. If, for example, your control implements the `init()` method, the `init()` of the superclass will no longer be executed. The control is then no longer properly initialized and this typically causes an error. To avoid breaking the control, call the superclass method.\n> \n> Consider also that the superclass might implement the method later on, or removes its own method implementation because it is not needed anymore. We recommend that you check for the existence of the superclass method before calling it:\n> \n> ```js\n> \n> sap.ui.somelib.SomeControl.extend(\"my.OwnControl\", {\n>        ...\n>        init: function() {\n>              if (sap.ui.somelib.SomeControl.prototype.init) { // check whether superclass implements the method\n>                     sap.ui.somelib.SomeControl.prototype.init.apply(this, arguments); // call the method with the original arguments\n>              }\n> \n>              //... do any further initialization of your subclass... \n>        } \n> ```\n\n> ### Note:  \n> When you modify the HTML of a control using the code in the control behavior file, make sure to escape any unchecked data you write with `sap.base.security.encodeXML(...)` to prevent cross-site-scripting issues. For more information, see [Cross-Site Scripting](../05_Developing_Apps/cross-site-scripting-91f0bd3.md).\n\n",
