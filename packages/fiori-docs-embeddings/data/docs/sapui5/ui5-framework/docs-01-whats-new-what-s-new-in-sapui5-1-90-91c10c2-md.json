The period of inactivity can vary between 5 to 60 minutes. A session timeout dialog appears automatically to inform the user.For more information, see the [sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.IllustratedMessage/sample/sap.f.sample.IllustratedMessageSessionTimeout).\n\n-   The second sample demonstrates the TNT Illustration Set where you can preview the illustration types in the different illustration sizes.For more information, see the [sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.IllustratedMessage/sample/sap.f.sample.IllustratedMessageInPageTNT).\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.90</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2021-05-20\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.90 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.gantt`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.gantt`**\n\nKey users can now use the new customization feature to make changes to the user interface of a Gantt chart as per their requirements.

Usage of the property with `StartAndEnd` value is recommended for scenarios, where the order of the tabs is important; for example, when the tabs represent process steps.

This feature allows a single HTTP POST \\(batch\\) request to be sent to both OData V2 and V4 services, which improves the performance.
