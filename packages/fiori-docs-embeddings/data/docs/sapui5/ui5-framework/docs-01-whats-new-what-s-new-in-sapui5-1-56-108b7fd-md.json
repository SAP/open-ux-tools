Arithmetic expressions can be entered using a touch-friendly visual editor or a textual editor that provides autocomplete suggestions for variables and checks the expression syntax as you type.\n\nFor more information, see [Calculation Builder](../10_More_About_Controls/calculation-builder-1db5047.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.commons.CalculationBuilder) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.CalculationBuilder).\n\n![Calculation Builder with Autocomplete Suggestions](images/Suite_Calculation_Builder_0eb83de.png)\n\n<sub>New•Control•Info Only•1.56</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2018-08-02\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.56\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nNew \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartmultiinput.SmartMultiInput`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartmultiinput.SmartMultiInput`**\n\nActs as a wrapper control for `sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField` and supports the same settings and annotations.

Thanks to the annotation support, smart multi-input fields and comboboxes can be embedded into other smart controls, such as `sap.ui.comp.smartform.SmartForm`.\n\nFor more information, see [Smart Multi Input](../10_More_About_Controls/smart-multi-input-5644169.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartmultiinput.SmartMultiInput) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartmultiinput.SmartMultiInput).\n\n![Smart Multi Input Fields](images/Suite_Smart_Multi_Input_ece2f96.png)\n\n<sub>New•Control•Info Only•1.56</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2018-08-02\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.56\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**\n\nThe new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model has the following features:\n\n-   Binding parameter `$$ownRequest` to enforce that a binding sends its own requests.\n\n-   Binding parameter `$$aggregation` to display aggregated data.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > This feature is still a work in progress. So far it supports displaying a flat list of aggregated data or grouping by one groupable property without being able to expand.\n\n-   The refresh of a single row in an absolute list binding can now also take filters into account .\n\n-   When executing a deferred bound operation, the result of the promise returned by `v4.ODataContextBinding#execute` is the context representing the data of the bound operation response if certain conditions are fulfilled. For more information check the API for <code><a href=\"https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding/methods/execute\"><code>ODataContextBinding#execute</code></a></code>.\n\n\n> ### Restriction:  \n> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \\(such as tree binding\\). This also applies to smart controls \\(`sap.ui.comp` library\\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).\n\nFor more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.56</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2018-08-02\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.56\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Support Assistant** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Support Assistant**\n\n-   `sap.ui.support.ExecutionScope.getElements` has a new parameter `cloned`.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.support.ExecutionScope/methods/Summary).\n\n-   A *Filter* view showing the currently applied filter has been added to the *Issues* view of the Support Assistant. The *Clear Filtering* button \\(![](images/Clear_filter_icon_4a0cf3b.png)\\) has moved to the *Filter* view. It is active only when there is a filter selected.\n\n-   An explanatory note has been added to the *Additional Rulesets* view under the header to give more clarity about the function of these rulesets and why they are in a separate tab.\n\n-   The *Report* button is now fixed to the panel to be always visible and not to get into the overflow.\n\n-   The font sizes are aligned across all three views for consistency.\n\n-   In the *Issues* view the number of issues is only highlighted when there are issues of medium and high severity. This improvement helps to easily see the distribution of the issues by severity.\n\n\n![](images/Support_Assistant_UI_improvements_1_56_8830117.png)\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.56</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2018-08-02\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.56\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Spreadsheet Export** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Spreadsheet Export**\n\nHierarchical structures, such as the `Tree` table, are now enabled in the exported file in the `sap.ui.export` library based on the hierarchy level information provided.

When `enableAppointmentsDragAndDrop` is set to true, attaching the event handler to the `appointmentDragEnter` event can change the default behavior and allow appointments to be dragged on the same row and between calendar rows.\n\n-   Appointments can now be created in one `PlanningCalendarRow` by dragging with the mouse on an empty cell. This behavior is enabled with the `enableAppointmentCreate` boolean property. When creating is finished, an `appointmentCreate` event is fired.\n\n-   The new `enableAppointmentResize` boolean property provides the possibility to resize appointments in one `PlanningCalendarRow`. When resizing is finished, an `appointmentResize` event is fired.\n\n-   A new functionality to copy appointments by dragging them is added on the `PlanningCalendarRow` level. When you press [Ctrl\\]/[Cmd\\] while dragging an appointment, dropping it will create a copy.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.PlanningCalendarRow) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.PlanningCalendarDnD/preview).\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.56</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2018-08-02\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.56\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.PlanningCalendarRow`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.PlanningCalendarRow`**\n\nThe new `specialDates` aggregation allows you to mark special days on a row level.
