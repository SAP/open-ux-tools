For example, if you configure SAPClient as URL parameter, you cannot define an additional filter for SAPClient because this may result in an empty data response.\n\nYou can use the fields listed in the following table to configure a filter.\n\nNot all of the fields are relevant for each use case. For example, you can configure a value help request to determine the entries in the value help list. A context resolution request is necessary if the Smart Business context contains not only single values, but also other operators. The context resolution request then resolves the context into a list of single values. This is necessary because a filter can only display single values. For details about possible use cases, see [Use Cases for Configuring Filters](use-cases-for-configuring-filters-146f649.md).\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\">\n\nField\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nExplanation\n\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\">\n\nBasic Data\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFilter Title\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nThe label displayed for the filter at runtime.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nProperty\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nThe property for which you want to configure a filter. The value help is populated with the properties of all entity sets that are used in the configuration.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The value help is empty if you have not yet entered any request data in the configuration. To avoid this, ensure you enter the required request data before configuring a filter. Request data can be entered, for example, in the *Value Help* section below or in an analysis step.\n\nThe filter property is also used as the property displayed in the filter at runtime if an alias is not defined. Values that the user selects in the filter are handed over to the entire analysis path as filter.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nDo Not Show Filter at Runtime\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSelect this checkbox if you do not want to expose this filter at runtime. This is useful when a request requires a mandatory filter or parameter that is not coming in from outside APF, for example, with the Smart Business context,and if it is not necessary that users see or change the filter.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> When you select this checkbox, any information you may have entered for value help request and context resolution request is deleted. When you decide later on to show the filter at runtime, you must fill in this information again as required.\n\n\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSelection Mode\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChoose whether you want to allow single selection or multiple selections.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\">\n\nDefault Values\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nDefault Value Mode\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSelect *None* if you do not want any values to be selected by default. This option is useful for filters that are optional, have a lot of values, and support multiple selections.\n\nSelect *Automatic Values* if you want the system to determine the default values automatically. In case of single selection, the first entry in the value help of the filter is selected by default. In case of multiple selection, all values are selected by default.\n\nSelect *Fixed Values* if you want to list specific values that are preselected in the value help.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Do not enter sensitive data as default values for filters. Other APF users can read the configuration and thus have access to this data.\n\nSelect *Function* if you want to specify a JavaScript function that calculates the default values. This function must be included in the Business Server Pages \\(BSP\\) application.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Using a function to calculate the default values is not possible if you use the generic APF runtime application.\n\n\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nDefault Values/Function\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nDepending on the default value mode, either specify the fixed default values or a function.\n\nIf you want to enter a date as a fixed default value, you can do so in one of the following formats:\n\n-   <dd.mm.yyyy\\>, for example, 28.04.2018\n-   <mm/dd/yyyy\\>, for example, 04/28/2018\n-   <yyyy-mm-dd\\>, for example, 2018-04-28\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If a context is handed over from a Smart Business KPI tile for this filter property, this context replaces the default values. The default values are used as a fallback only. This is necessary because it is not possible to have an empty filter.\n\n\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"7\">\n\nValue Help\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nValue Help Mode\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSelect *Value Help Request* if you want to specify a request to generate the list of values in the value help.\n\nSelect *Configured List of Values* if you want to enter the values for the value help manually.\n\nSelect *None* if none of the above options applies. The values in the value help can then result only from default values or from a context that is handed over from outside, for example, from a Smart Business KPI tile.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nValues \\(displayed only when you select *Configured List of Values*\\)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nManual list of values for the value help.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\">\n\nThe following fields are displayed only when you select *Value Help Request*.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nService\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nPath to the OData service root.
