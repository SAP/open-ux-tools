For more information, see [App Development Using SAP Web IDE](../05_Developing_Apps/app-development-using-sap-web-ide-13ced94.md).\n\n<sub>Changed•Announcement•Info Only•1.71</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-10-10\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.71 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Rule Expressions in Expression Language 2.0** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Rule Expressions in Expression Language 2.0**\n\nYou can now type the rule expressions in expression language 2.0 in the rule builder control.

The call of `requestSideEffects` is propagated upwards in the binding hierarchy until a context binding or list binding that sends its own data requests is found. During the propagation, list bindings that do not send own data requests must not be passed.\n\n-   Metadata parsing now uses a last-one-wins strategy for duplicated names consistently, also if operations are part of the duplicates.\n\n-   With the model setting `autoExpandSelect:true`, property bindings that become active after their parent context or list binding has sent the first data request will be able to store their data so it can be reused by a later property binding with the same relative path and the same binding context.\n\n\n> ### Restriction:  \n> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing freestyle and SAP Fiori elements applications. Double-check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \\(such as tree binding\\). This also applies to smart controls \\(`sap.ui.comp` library\\) that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported in combination with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).\n\nFor more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.71</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-10-10\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.71 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Static Checks on Apps in the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Static Checks on Apps in the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository**\n\nYou can now use Code Inspector to perform certain checks for SAPUI5 apps that are stored in the SAPUI5 ABAP repository.
