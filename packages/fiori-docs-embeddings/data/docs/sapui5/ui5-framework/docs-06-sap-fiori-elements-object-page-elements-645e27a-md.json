It is suitable for both simple objects and more complex, multi-faceted objects. The object page view gives you optimal support for multiple devices.\n\n\n\nThis image is interactive. Hover over each area for a description. Click highlighted areas for more information.\n\n![](images/Image_Map_Object_Page_Elements_in_SAP_Fiori_Elements_V4_e14e87e.png)\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio645e27ae85d54c8cbc3f6722184a24a1__section_m13_dsz_mlb\"/>\n\n## Main Elements of the Object Page\n\nThe object page is made up of the following elements:\n\n-   Page title that is set to the object type, for example *Sales Order* or *Product*\n\n-   Object header including the following: Action buttons in the object page header\n\n    -   Title and subtitle\n\n    -   Editing status icon, if applicable\n\n    -   Action buttons in the toolbar of the object page header, containing generic actions \\(in *Display* mode\\)\n\n    -   Optional elements, such as:\n\n        -   A description\n\n        -   An image of the object instance\n\n            > ### Note:  \n            > If the instance does not provide an image, then the default image of the object type is used.\n\n        -   Buttons in the header toolbar for use case-specific actions, for example, *Edit* and *Delete*\n\n        -   Header facets to showcase important information relating to the object. Header facets can contain:\n\n            -   Label-field pairs, to show, for example, price or availability. We recommend not to use more than five label-field pairs.\n\n            -   a chart detailing the credit limit, or a rating indicator\n\n\n\n\n-   Anchor navigation area that lets users navigate to the individual content area sections\n\n-   Content area in which data is organized into sections that can contain field groups or a table\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > It is not possible to add an image in the content area for SAP Fiori elements for OData V2.\n\n-   Paginator buttons on the detail page to browse from item to item in the list the user came from\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > The paginator buttons are only visible if these conditions are fulfilled:\n    > \n    > -   The user comes from a list to the current page.\n    > -   This list contains at least two entries.\n    > -   The user is on a subobject page.\n\n    On the first object page, the paginator buttons are disabled by default.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > You can only adapt the UI to enable them with SAP Fiori elements for OData V2.\n\n    For more information, see [Adapting the UI: List Report and Object Page](adapting-the-ui-list-report-and-object-page-0d2f1a9.md).\n\n-   Footer bar in which actions and the *Show Messages* button are available, if applicable.\n\n    In draft applications, the footer bar of subitem object pages can also include the *Apply* button in create and edit mode. This action concludes the current create or edit activity, saves the draft, and navigates one step up in the object hierarchy. A toast message is displayed when an operation is successful. For more information, see [Draft Handling](draft-handling-ed9aa41.md). In a draft application with flexible column layout, the subobject closes and returns to the main object if you click the *Apply* button.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio645e27ae85d54c8cbc3f6722184a24a1__section_s13_dsz_mlb\"/>\n\n## Related Information\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nSubject\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nLink\n\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControls related to object pages\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n[sap.uxap](../10_More_About_Controls/sap-uxap-de71337.md) \n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nAnnotations used to set up various elements of object pages\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n[Configuring Object Page Features](configuring-object-page-features-d26d3dd.md)\n\n[Configuring Further Common Features](configuring-further-common-features-a4d3c46.md)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n",
