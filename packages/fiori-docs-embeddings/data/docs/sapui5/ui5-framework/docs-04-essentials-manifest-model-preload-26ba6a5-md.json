For a local JSON, XML or resource model it does not make sense as it interferes with the component preload, which will result in loading the model data twice, and should be omitted. But for the OData model \\(V2 or V4\\), for example, using the preload option speeds up performance, as the OData metadata can already be loaded in parallel to the component preload.\n\nBefore enabling the preload for the OData model \\(V2 or V4\\), make sure that you listen properly to metadata loaded by using the `Promise` API instead of the `Event` API \\(`metadataLoaded`\\), since the preload could have loaded the metadata already before the application code is executed. The Promise will be executed even if the metadata loaded event has been raised already.\n\nFor the OData V2 model, also consider using the model parameter `earlyTokenRequest`. For more information, see the [API Reference: `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel). \n\nFor the OData V4 model, set the model parameter `earlyRequests` to `true`, so that the root metadata and security token are requested directly after creating the model instance. For more information, see the [API Reference: `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel). \n\nListen properly to metadata loaded by using the Promise:\n\n```js\n\nvar oModel  = this.oModel, // sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel\n    that = this;\noModel.metadataLoaded(true).then(\n    function () {\n        // model is ready now\n        oModel.createKey(\"PERSON\", {\"ID\" : 4711, \"TASK_GUID\": \"myguid\"});\n    },\n    function () {\n        // Display error information so that the user knows that the application does not work.\n        that.navigateToErrorPage();\n    });\n```\n\n",
