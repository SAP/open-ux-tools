You can also specify whether or not the line endings are adjusted automatically during the upload.\n\nFor more information, see the report documentation in your ABAP system.\n\n\n\n## Uploading SAPUI5 Apps From an Archive\n\nPrerequisite: The files to be uploaded are located on an HTTP web server.\n\n-   To upload an SAPUI5 app from a zip or war archive, use the report `/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD_HTTP`.\n-   To upload multiple SAPUI5 apps from a zip or war archive at once, use the report `/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD_HTTPN`.\n\nEnter the relevant parameters and specify whether or not the line endings are adjusted automatically during the upload. You can also provide the parameters in the file `.Ui5RepositoryUploadParameters` located in the archive. Each line represents a parameter. The format is `<parameter name> = <parameter value>`.\n\nIf you use SAP Business Application Studio for developing apps, we recommend that you deploy your app as described here: [Deploy to the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository](https://help.sap.com/viewer/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d/Cloud/en-US/340cf0109ec6451c88f7a0129990de59.html).\n\nIf you use the `/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD_HTTP` and `/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD_HTTPN` reports to upload your project to the SAPUI5 ABAP repository instead, make sure that you upload only the content of the `webapp` or `dist` folder without the folder itself. This ensures that the`manifest.json` is in the root of the structure in the SAPUI5 ABAP repository and the app index can be loaded.\n\nYou can also specify whether the reports run in delta or in test mode:\n\n-   Delta mode: You only want to upload the files that are new or that have been modified.\n-   Test mode: You want to see a log file displaying what the report is doing.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If you use the reports, the SAPUI5 application index is updated automatically and any errors are displayed. For more information, see [SAPUI5 Application Index](sapui5-application-index-c5e7098.md).\n\nThe functions of the reports are also available in the RFC-enabled function module `/UI5/REPO_LOAD_FROM_ZIP_URL`. It can be called remotely, for example, from Maven builds. For more information, see the documentation of the reports and of the function module `/UI5/REPO_LOAD_FROM_ZIP_URL`.\n\n",
