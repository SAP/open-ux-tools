Inline scripts are not required anymore, but you must still allow `eval()` for SAPUI5 to run. For details about the supported policies, and for recommendations on writing CSP-compliant applications, see [Content Security Policy](../05_Developing_Apps/content-security-policy-fe1a6db.md).\n\n> ### Note:  \n> An application needs to be prepared to the used policy to run in a CSP-enabled environment.\n\n<sub>New•Feature•Info Only•1.61</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2018-12-20\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.61 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nNew \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n<code><b><code>sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar</code></b></code> \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n<code><b><code>sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar</code></b></code>\n\nThe `sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar` is a new control designed to display the schedule of a single resource. It can display three types of time intervals - a single day, a work week, or a full week. You can add custom actions to facilitate the interaction with the control.\n\n  \n  \n**SinglePlanningCalendar Header Area**\n\n![](images/SinglePlanningCalendar_Header_9406ea7.png \"SinglePlanningCalendar Header Area\")\n\n  \n  \n**SinglePlanningCalendar Meetings**\n\n![](images/SinglePlanningCalendar_Meetings_b99c835.png \"SinglePlanningCalendar Meetings\")\n\nFor more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar).\n\n<sub>New•Control•Info Only•1.61</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2018-12-20\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.61 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**\n\nThe new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:\n\n-   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#refresh` is supported for the bound context and the return value context of `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding`.\n\n-   You can now use `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#requestSideEffects` to load side effects when implicit loading is switched off via the binding-specific parameter `$$patchWithoutSideEffects`. This method must only be called on the bound context of a context binding, or on the return value context of an operation binding. With SAPUI5 1.61, there is only basic support for :n navigations, that is, the complete context is refreshed.\n\n-   For the calculation of the path for reading data, relative bindings use the path of the context instead of the canonical path. The creation of a new entity uses the deep path as well. Use the `$$canonicalPath` binding-specific parameter to switch to the old behavior.\n\n\nNote that we have introduced this change to support message processing.\n\n> ### Restriction:  \n> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \\(such as tree binding\\). This also applies to smart controls \\(`sap.ui.comp` library\\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.61</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2018-12-20\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.61 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.DynamicPage`/`sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.DynamicPage`/`sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage`**\n\n-   With the use of the new accessibility `landmarkInfo` aggregation, you can now set custom accessibility roles and labels for the different sections of the pages.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.DynamicPageAccessibleLandmarkInfo).\n\n-   We have enabled the controls to be a droppable area.

For example, in a donut chart with sectors A, B, C, and Others, navigation from Others sector leads to a filter condition excluding A, B, and C. For more information, see [Chart Cards Used in Overview Pages](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/chart-cards-used-in-overview-pages-68e62ad.md)\n\n-   You can assign specific colours to the sectors within the donut chart.
