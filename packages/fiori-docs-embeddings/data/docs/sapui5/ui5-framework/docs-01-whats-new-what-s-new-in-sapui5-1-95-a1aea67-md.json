If set to `true`, any created entities are removed.\n\n-   The `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#deleteCreatedEntry` method has been deprecated. It does not update controls but cannot be changed for compatibility reasons. Applications should use `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#resetChanges` instead.\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.95</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2021-10-07\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.95 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nUI Changed \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nAnnouncement \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAP Fiori Elements: Worklist Apps: Sort, Group, and Filter Options Moved to Table Personalization** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAP Fiori Elements: Worklist Apps: Sort, Group, and Filter Options Moved to Table Personalization**\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The following information concerns important changes for end users.

You can use this API in a list-detail scenario to load details first, as described in [Data Reuse](../04_Essentials/data-reuse-648e360.md). Note that this method is still a work in progress and should not be used for productive applications yet.\n\n-   An absolute property binding with a path that ends in `$count` now supports the `$apply`, `$filter`, and `$search` OData system query options.\n\n-   You can now provide handlers that provide the security token header. Note that expiration is currently only supported for the `X-CSRF-Token` header. For more information, see [Security Token Handling](../04_Essentials/model-instantiation-and-data-access-9613f1f.md#loio9613f1f2d88747cab21896f7216afdac__section_STH).\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.95</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2021-10-07\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.95 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Button`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Button`**\n\nWe have improved the accessibility of the control, and the screen readers now announce when there is a change in the text, tooltip, or icon in a stand-alone `sap.m.Button`.

When pressed, the control navigates to the current date and focuses on it. This feature is available for pickers whose display format allows picking a day. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.DatePicker) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.DatePicker/sample/sap.m.sample.DatePicker).\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.95</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2021-10-07\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.95 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n<code><b>sap.m.StandardListItem</b></code> \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.StandardListItem`**\n\nInformation texts in lists can now also be wrapped if wrapping is enabled for this control.

This feature enables host-environment developers to implement client-side data caching. Additionally, card developers have options to control what data is cached and how it should be cached. For more information, see the [Data Handling - Cache](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/data), [Integrate - Caching](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/data) sections, and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/cache) in the Card Explorer.\n\n-   The side indicators in the numeric header of the card now support semantic colors. This functionality is achieved using the new `state` property of the `SideIndicator`. For more information, see the [Analytical Card Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/analytical) in the Card Explorer.\n\n-   We have added a new `refreshData` method. You can use it to refresh only that part of the card that shows new data, without rerendering the whole card. For more information, see the [Refresh Data Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/extension/refreshData) in the Card Explorer.\n\n-   The Analytical type card can now visualize \\(in experimental state\\) all charts from the `sap.viz` library. To enable it, we have enhanced the card manifest with new properties - `feeds`, which allows developers to define more measures and dimensions, and `chartProperties` to customize the charts. The properties `legend`, `plotArea`, `title`, `dimensionAxis`, and `measureAxis` are now deprecated. For more information, see the [Analytical Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/analytical) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/analytical/bubble) in the Card Explorer.\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.95</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2021-10-07\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.95 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSAP Fiori Elements \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAP Fiori elements for OData V2** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAP Fiori elements for OData V2**\n\nThe following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V2:\n\n-   List report now supports default sort order and visualizations that are coming from the presentation variant.\n\n-   A new extension API is now available that can hook into the live cycle method of the `sap-keep-alive` feature. For more information, see [Refresh Data Set for Back Navigation When sap-keep-alive Is Set to True](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/refresh-data-set-for-back-navigation-when-sap-keep-alive-is-set-to-true-f1c2704.md).\n\n-   Responsive tables in an object page can now be configured to load more than the default value of 10. For more information, see [Adapting the UI: List Report and Object Page](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adapting-the-ui-list-report-and-object-page-0d2f1a9.md).\n\n-   The confirmation popup to discard drafts is now enabled by default for draft applications. For more information, see [Confirmation Popups](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/confirmation-popups-9a53662.md).\n\n-   The creation of an object using a dialog is now supported in multi-view applications.

For more information, see [Enabling the History of Recently Entered Values](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-the-history-of-recently-entered-values-37dbf1f.md).\n\n-   You can now configure a data refresh upon back navigation from an external app when keep-alive mode is enabled. For more information, see [Refresh Entity Sets in sap-keep-alive Mode](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/refresh-entity-sets-in-sap-keep-alive-mode-3c65f2c.md).\n\n-   Triggering side effects for structural changes in an object page table is now supported in non-draft applications. For more information, see [Side Effects](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/side-effects-18b17bd.md).\n\n-   You now have an option to mark the navigated row when `onListNavigationExtension` is used. For more information, see [Example: Enable Internal Navigation to Different Detail Page](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/example-enable-internal-navigation-to-different-detail-page-75002b3.md).\n\n-   You can now order the legends as per the dimension configuration within analytical charts for an overview page.
