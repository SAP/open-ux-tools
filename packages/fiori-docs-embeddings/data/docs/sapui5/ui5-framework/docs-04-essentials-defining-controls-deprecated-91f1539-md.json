HTML5 does not support self-closing tags.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> All attributes used to define properties, associations, events, or aggregations are data attributes except for attributes that exist in HTML, for example `id` or `class`. Data attributes are prefixed with `data-*`, for example `data-text`.\n\n",
