To correctly integrate your app extension coding with SAP Fiori elements, use only the `extensionAPI` of SAP Fiori elements. For more information, see [Using the extensionAPI](using-the-extensionapi-bd2994b.md).\n> \n> After you've created an app extension, its display \\(for example, control placement and layout\\) and system behavior \\(for example, model and binding usage, busy handling\\) lies within the application's responsibility. SAP Fiori elements provides support only for the official `extensionAPI` functions. Don't access or manipulate controls, properties, models, or other internal objects created by the SAP Fiori elements framework.\n\nThe extension point \\(`adaptTransientMessageExtension`\\) is hit always before the transient message is displayed. If your app uses the flexible column layout, the extension point of the list report, the extension point of the object page, and the analytical list page extension point are hit. Note that you have to ensure that the message model has been adapted for list report, object page, and analytical list page.\n\nPerform these steps:\n\n1.  Register your extension in the `manifest.json`, as follows:\n\n    ```\n    \"extends\": {\n       \"extensions\": {\n          ... \n          \"sap.ui.controllerExtensions\": { \n             ...\n             \"sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ListReport.view.ListReport\": { \n                ... \n                \"controllerName\": \"STTA_MP.ext.controller.ListReportExtension\",\n                ...\n             }\n          } \n          ...\n    \n    ```\n\n2.  Implement your controller extension.\n\n    You have to implement the `adaptTransientMessageExtension` function within the list report controller extension, the object page controller extension, or the analytical list page extension, respectively.\n\n    ```\n        // \"Messaging\" required from module \"sap/ui/core/Messaging\"\n        // \"Message\" required from module \"sap/ui/core/message/Message\"\n        // \"MessageType\" required from module \"sap/ui/core/MessageType\"\n        adaptTransientMessageExtension:function() {\n                if (Messaging.getMessageModel().oData.length) {\n                        var msgText = \"This message has been added through List Extension\" ;\n                        var consolidatedMessage = new Message({\n                            message: msgText,\n                            type: MessageType.Information,\n                            target: '',\n                            persistent: true\n                        });\n                        Messaging.addMessages(consolidatedMessage);\n                }\t\t\n        }\n        \n        ```\n    ```\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The extension point is only available for transient messages. Do not make any changes to state messages from the message model \\(`Messaging.getMessageManager().getMessageModel()`\\) where `Messaging` is required from module `sap/ui/core/Messaging`.\n> \n> Do not alter the target of any message from the message model as this may cause the message model services to stop working.\n\n",
