Note that `node.js` is not an officially supported environment.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiob8fdf0c903424c9191f142842323ae22__section_dcz_jnh_y2b\"/>\n\n## Compatibility With Existing Modules\n\nThe modules are introduced with SAPUI5 version 1.58 and replace the existing larger core modules to make the code easier to understand and maintain, and to decrease the initial payload of SAPUI5. To avoid that the removal of dependencies caused by the switch to the new modules causes exceptions, a lazy loading of the legacy modules is provided. For compatibility reasons, this lazy loading is done synchronously and it provides just the API namespace without loading the actual implementation.\n\n![](images/Image_Modularization_81e22f4.png)\n\nAs it may not be obvious where those calls occur or where a dependency is missing, a rule in the Support Assistant reports the use and provides guidance on how to avoid them. A second rule with lower priority reports the use of an `jQuery.sap` API in general. There are also log warnings in the console of the browser's development tools, including a stack trace which makes it easy to locate the call in your coding.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiob8fdf0c903424c9191f142842323ae22__section_wbd_lph_y2b\"/>\n\n## Migration\n\nTo benefit from the improvements provided by the modules, perform the following steps:\n\n-   Always declare the full dependencies as described in [Loading a Module](loading-a-module-d12024e.md).\n\n-   Migrate to the new module APIas described in [Replacement of Deprecated jQuery APIs](replacement-of-deprecated-jquery-apis-a075ed8.md). Do **not** use the global `jQuery.sap` API anymore.\n\n-   Do **not** use the global `sap.ui` factory functions. Instead, use their replacements; see [Deprecated Factories Replacement](deprecated-factories-replacement-491bd9c.md).\n\n\n",
