If you want to make changes to the application, you can do so using the APF Configuration Modeler. Proceed as follows:\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Steps 1 through 8 are relevant for SAP Business Suite powered by SAP HANA only. If you use SAP S/4HANA, proceed with step 9.\n\n1.  In your SAP Fiori frontend server system, run transaction `SE80`.\n\n2.  In the Repository Browser, select `BSP Application` and enter the name of your Business Server Page \\(BSP\\) application.\n\n3.  In the folder structure, open *Page Fragments* \\> *config* and double-click the analytical configuration file to open it.\n\n4.  Copy the entire content of the file and paste it into a text editor.\n\n5.  Save the text file using the file extension `.json`.\n\n6.  Go to *Page Fragments* \\> *i18n* and double-click the .properties file for the required language.\n\n7.  Copy the entire content of the file and paste it into a text editor.\n\n8.  Save the text file using the file extension .properties.\n\n9.  Import the JSON file and the `.properties` text file into the APF Configuration Modeler app in one of the following ways:\n\n    -   If you use SAP Business Suite powered by SAP HANA, choose *Import* and specify the files you want to import.\n\n        > ### Note:  \n        > You can import the `.properties` file in any language. This allows you to switch the development language.\n\n    -   If you use SAP S/4HANA, choose *Import Delivered Content* and select the desired configuration from the value help.\n\n        > ### Note:  \n        > You can import the `.properties` file in the development language only.\n\n\n10. Make the required changes in the APF Configuration Modeler as explained under [APF Configuration Modeler](apf-configuration-modeler-b57224b.md) and save the configuration.\n\n    For example:\n\n    -   Change requests, for example, to replace the shipped data provisioning with your own one.\n    -   Create new categories for the analysis step gallery.\n    -   Reassign steps to other categories.\n    -   Create new analysis steps.\n    -   Add representation types to a step.\n    -   Change filter configurations.\n    -   Add or change navigation targets.\n\n11. Ensure that the correct configuration has been specified in the tile definition. To do so, proceed as follows:\n    -   For SAP Business Suite powered by SAP HANA:\n\n        If you launch your application from a Smart Business KPI tile, ensure that the correct configuration is selected in the *Configure KPI Tiles* app.\n\n        If you launch your application from a Fiori app launcher tile, maintain the configuration ID as the value for parameter `sap-apf-configuration-id`.\n\n    -   For SAP S/4HANA:\n\n        If you launch your application from a Smart Business KPI tile, ensure that the correct configuration is selected in the *Create Tile* app.\n\n        If you launch your application from a Fiori app launcher tile, maintain the application ID and the configuration ID as the value for parameter `sap-apf-configuration-id` in the format *<application ID\\>*.*<configuration ID\\>*.\n\n\n12. If you changed or created texts that must be translated into languages other than your development language, export the text pool into a .properties file and perform the file-based translation process.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[APF Configuration Modeler](apf-configuration-modeler-b57224b.md \"\")\n\n[Configuring the SAP Smart Business KPI Tile](configuring-the-sap-smart-business-kpi-tile-374364e.md \"\")\n\n[Import](import-6528aa8.md \"\")\n\n[Translation](translation-4510c30.md \"\")\n\n",
