Whenever you create, change, or delete a configuration, a notification is created in the system. You can then use these apps to transport the files.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If you just want to create a backup copy of your files, you can use the export function of the APF Configuration Modeler and don't need the apps *Export Software Collection* and *Import Collection*.\n\nTo find the configuration you want to export in the *Import Collection* app, you can search, for example, for \"Analysis Path Framework\", the configuration name, or the configuration GUID.\n\nFor more information, see the documentation for your Cloud version at [https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP\\_S4HANA\\_CLOUD](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD) under *Product Assistance* \\> **<language\\>** \\> *Generic Information* \\> *General Functions for the Key User* \\> *Extensibility*, chapters *Export Software Collection* and *Import Collection*.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Export](export-7de4975.md \"\")\n\n",
