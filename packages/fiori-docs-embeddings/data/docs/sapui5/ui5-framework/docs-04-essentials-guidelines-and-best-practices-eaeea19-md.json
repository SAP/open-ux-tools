Avoid too generic or unspecific rules that would produce excessive number of issues difficult to digest or follow up. The rules should focus on one issue and provide a resolution for it.\n\n-   **Reduce the number of issues generated**\n\n    Do not overload the user with a large number of issues. When appropriate, produce one issue where multiple texts are concatenated with `\\n` delimiter.\n\n-   **Write clear descriptions and resolutions**\n\n    Use the guidelines in [Create a Ruleset for a Library](create-a-ruleset-for-a-library-b5a5135.md)\n\n\n",
