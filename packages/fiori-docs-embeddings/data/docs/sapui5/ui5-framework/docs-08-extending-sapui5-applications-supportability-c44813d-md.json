In a support case, for example, you can set a breakpoint early in the `sap-ui-core.js` and then execute the following code in the browser developer tool console:\n\n```js\n \n  window[\"sap-ui-config\"] = window[\"sap-ui-config\"] ||{};\n  window[\"sap-ui-config\"][\"xxDisableCustomizing\"] = true;\n```\n\n> ### Note:  \n> For security reasons, it is not possible to use a URL parameter.\n\n\n\n## Using the Log\n\nThe console log contains information about the processing of customizing or extensibility information. Depending on the importance of the respective information, different log levels are used. To enable a certain log level, execute the following code in the browser console:\n\n```js\n\n// \"Log\" required from module \"sap/base/Log\"\nLog.setLevel(Log.Level.INFO)\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can set the log level to `INFO` in the support popup if you want to see all messages of level \"INFO\" or more important.\n\nThe following information is provided per log level:\n\n-   `WARNING`/`ERROR`: Any critical or error situation; such messages must be checked because something may have gone wrong\n\n-   `INFO`: Information about successful customizing activities, such as applying a view extension or modifying a control property\n\n-   `DEBUG`: Information about \"non-activities\", for example, if no extension configured for an extension point was found; this provides comprehensive information for each situation where an extension might be configured. Exception: Non-existing control property modifications are **not** logged at this log level \\(see below how you can enable this\\). In addition, a complete dump of the extensibility configuration is logged when it is activated.\n\n\n",
