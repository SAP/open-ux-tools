For SAP NetWeaver 7.31 and lower releases, you install User Interface Add-On for SAP NetWeaver to use APF.\n\n\n\n## Implementation of Fiori Content for APF\n\nThe following technical catalog contains all tiles and target mappings required for APF-related apps: `SAP_TC_CA_APF_COMMON` \\(SAP: APF Technical Catalog\\)\n\nThe following role, group, and catalogs are relevant for the APF Configuration Modeler:\n\n-   Group `SAP_CA_BCG_APF_MODELING` \\(Analysis Path Framework\\)\n-   Business Role `SAP_BR_ANALYTICS_SPECIALIST` \\(Analytics Specialist\\)\n\n    This role has the following business catalogs assigned:\n\n    -   `SAP_CA_BC_APF_MODELING` \\(APF Modeling\\) for the APF Configuration Modeler\n\n    -   `SAP_CA_BC_APF_EXECUTION` \\(APF Execution\\) for the generic runtime application\n\n\n\nThe following catalog is relevant for the generic runtime application: `SAP_CA_BC_APF_EXECUTION` \\(APF Execution\\)\n\nAssign this catalog to a role. Users that are assigned this role can then use the generic runtime application.\n\n\n\n## Path Persistence on the Back-End Server\n\nTo enable the path persistence on the back-end server, you must ensure that the OData service `BSANLY_APF_RUNTIME_SRV` is activated. If you also use a front-end server, you must also activate the service there.\n\nYou can activate the service using transaction `/IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE`.\n\n",
