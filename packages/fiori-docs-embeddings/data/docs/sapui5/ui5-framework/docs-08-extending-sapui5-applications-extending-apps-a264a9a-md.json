For example, you can adapt or replace views, extend or replace controllers, or change language-specific texts.\n\nWith SAPUI5 you have the option to extend your applications.You can do so by using SAPUI5 flexibility or component configuration.\n\n[SAPUI5 flexibility](using-sapui5-flexibility-72861c2.md) is the preferred way to extend SAP Fiori elements-based apps for versions 1.56 or higher. It uses a better interface, supports layering as well as lifecycle hooks.\n\n[Using Component Configuration](using-component-configuration-c264d66.md) is intended for versions below 1.56 and for freestyle SAPUI5 applications. It is based on merge, supports only override of methods and requires additional component configurations. The extension information is stored in a specific area of the component configuration. It can be performed on a custom app that extends a delivered standard app. A replacement or extension of views and custom controllers can also be part of a custom app, but may not always be required. If no replacement and no custom controller exists, the custom app project only contains the component definition with the extension configuration. The standard app itself is not changed. The customized app becomes the start-up project and launches the standard app with the additional extension configuration.\n\nFor more information on how to create layered controller extensions in SAP Web IDE, see Related Information.\n\nBy using key user adaptation, users with the key user authorization role can also make extensive UI changes for apps without having to change the code. For more information, see [SAPUI5 Flexibility: Enable Your App for UI Adaptation](../05_Developing_Apps/sapui5-flexibility-enable-your-app-for-ui-adaptation-f1430c0.md).\n\nThe flexible programming model for SAP Fiori elements enables you to adapt your applications to meet specific requirements. It allows the introduction of custom logic or controls beyond standard SAP Fiori elements features. With this model, you can integrate SAPUI5 controls and custom code into extension points and make use of predefined building blocks and controller extensions to enhance and customize your applications. For more information, see [Flexible Programming Model](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/flexible-programming-model-549749b.md).\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Layering Concept](../04_Essentials/layering-concept-9e63057.md \"SAPUI5 flexibility uses a consistent layering concept to store the UI changes as semantic delta information. This layering concept applies consistently to all users of SAPUI5 flexibility (end users, key users, and developers).\")\n\n",
