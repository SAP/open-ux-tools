The `CustomData` value is written as an attribute value.\n\nFor this, the key has to be a valid HTML ID and the value has to be a string; otherwise an error is logged.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> HTML attribute names are case-insensitive and browsers may convert the key to lowercase.\n> \n> Do not write too much data into the DOM.\n\nIn JavaScript, you can set the flag as shown in the following code snippet:\n\n```js\n\nmyButton.data(\"mydata\", \"Hello\", true); // attach some data to the Button and mark it as\n          \"write to HTML\"\n```\n\nTo set the `writeToDom` flag in XML views, the aggregation has to be written in expanded notation:\n\n```xml\n\n<Button ... >\n  <customData>\n  <core:CustomData key=\"mydata\" value=\"Hello\" writeToDom=\"true\" />\n  </customData>\n</Button>\n```\n\nThis results in the following HTML:\n\n```\n<button ...  data-myData=\"Hello\"  ... >\n```\n\nThe CSS can now use attribute selectors to check the presence or the value of the custom data attribute:\n\n```\n\nbutton[data-mydata=\"Hello\"] { border: 3px solid red !important; }\n```\n\n",
