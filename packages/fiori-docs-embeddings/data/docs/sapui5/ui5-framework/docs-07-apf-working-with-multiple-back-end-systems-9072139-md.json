For each back-end system, you can configure a SAP Fiori tile with the corresponding `sap-system` parameter, so you can have several tiles for the same APF-based app accessing data from different systems.\n\nAPF uses the general concept for SAP Fiori applications on multiple back-end systems. For more information, search for \"Configuring Multiple Back-End Systems Using the sap-system Parameter\" in the documentation of your SAP NetWeaver version on the SAP Help Portal at [https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP\\_NETWEAVER](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_NETWEAVER).\n\nIn particular, you must do the following:\n\n-   Assign all required back-end systems to your analytical OData services.\n\n-   If you want to save your analysis paths on multiple back-end systems, you must also assign those back-end systems to the service `BSANLY_APF_RUNTIME_SRV`, which is used for path persistence.\n\n-   If you use static app launcher tiles to launch an APF-based app, go to the tile configuration and add the parameter `sap-system=<SYSTEM_ALIAS>`. Create one tile for each back-end system you want to connect the app to. For each tile, enter the system alias of one back-end system as the `sap-system` parameter.\n\n-   If you navigate to an APF-based app from somewhere else, for example, from a SAP Smart Business generic drill-down app that also uses the `sap-system` parameter, the `sap-system` parameter is handed over to APF via intent-based navigation.\n\n\nAs a result, APF interprets the `sap-system` parameter and reacts as follows:\n\n-   All OData requests that are used when running an APF-based app are sent with an origin segment parameter `o` that corresponds to the specified `sap-system` parameter.\n\n-   When navigating away from the APF-based app, the `sap-system` parameter is added to the URL of the navigation target.\n\n-   When executing a configuration from the APF Configuration Modeler, the `sap-system` parameter is added to the URL of the generic runtime application.\n\n\n",
