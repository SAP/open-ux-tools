As this is the default property of `listItemType`, change it to a different value if you want the event to be fired.\n> \n> To test swipe gestures on desktop devices, open the Google Chrome developer tools, and within Settings → Overrides, check the \"Emulate touch events\" checkbox and reload the page.\n\n",
