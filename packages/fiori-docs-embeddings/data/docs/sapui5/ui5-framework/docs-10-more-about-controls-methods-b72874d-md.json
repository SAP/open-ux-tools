After this interaction, for example on tap event, you can use this method to hide `swipeContent` from the screen. By default, swipe for action works in auto-hide mode. This means that if a user tries to tap inside the list but outside the `swipeContent`, then the `swipeContent` hides automatically. After you call this method, `swipeContent` hides with animation and if you need to run code after the animation you can simply add a callback function to this method as a first parameter.\n-   `getSwipedItem()`: This method returns the currently swiped list item. When no item is swiped, null is returned. The `swipeContent` events, for example tap, are a good place to use this method to get information for which list item `swipeContent` is shown.\n\nThe following example shows a delete scenario:\n\n```js\n\ntap : function(e) {\n   var oList = this.getView().byId(\"myList\"); // get the list using its Id\n   var oSwipedItem = oList.getSwipedItem(); // Get which list item is swiped to delete\n   oList.removeAggregation(\"items\", oSwipedItem); // Remove this aggregation to delete list item from list\n   oList.swipeOut(); // we are done, hide the swipeContent from screen \n}\n....\n\n```\n\n",
