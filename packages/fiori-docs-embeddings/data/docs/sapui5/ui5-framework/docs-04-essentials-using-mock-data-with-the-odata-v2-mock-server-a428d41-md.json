We recommend to provide one check for this parameter in the app in a central place, for example in the `model.Config` object in the `model` folder.\n\n```\n// module:model/Config\nsap.ui.define([], function() {\n    return {\n        isMock: (\"true\" === new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(\"responderOn\"));\n    }\n});\n```\n\nTo run your app with mock data, you can use the mock server. The mock server intercepts HTTP calls to the server and produces a faked output to the client. This is transparent to your data binding and the OData model you use, and feels like a real server. You start the mock server when you initialize your app as follows:\n\n```\nsap.ui.define([\n    \"model/Config\",\n    \"sap/ui/app/Application\",\n    \"sap/ui/core/util/MockServer\"], function(ModelConfig, BaseApplication, MockServer) {\n    return BaseApplication.extend(\"Application\", {\n        init : function () {\n            ...\n            // start mock server\n            if (ModelConfig.isMock) {\n                const oMockServer = new MockServer({\n                    rootUri: ModelConfig.getServiceUrl();\n                });\n                oMockServer.simulate(\"model/metadata.xml\", \"model/\");\n                oMockServer.start();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThe mock server needs a metadata XML file that describes the data structure of your service. You can obtain this by opening the OData service root URL in a browser with the suffix \"$metadata\" appended. Copy the resulting XML file into the model folder of your application.\n\nRemove any kind of link that points to internal servers.\n\nThe following two options for providing mock data exist:\n\n-   Provide your own mock data\n\n    You can provide JSON files as test data for the mock server to produce the output. Put all files into the model folder. To avoid a \"not found\" error messages of the mock server, provide JSON files for each entity of the service. Otherwise, the mock server will log those error messages to the console and create empty data sets for the entities lacking a respective JSON data file. This is all right, in case you do not want to load mock data for those entities. The mock server can also generate mock data for those entities by passing a parameter to the simulate function.\n\n-   Mock server generates the mock data\n\n    The mock server can produce random mock data based on the service metadata it simulates. This can be done easily by providing the path to the metadata fil and omitting the second parameter of the simulate function. However, this option does not provide data that matches your business scenario.\n\n\n",
