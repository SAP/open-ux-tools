If the route contains a target, the target is displayed. The listener callbacks of controllers listening to this route are provided with data. When changing the hash, all listeners to this hash are informed.\n\nThe method uses the following parameters:\n\n-   `name` of the route parameter\n\n-   route `parameters`\n\n-   route information for the `Component` target\\(s\\), see [Navigate with Nested Components](navigate-with-nested-components-8e9d6e4.md).\n\n-   `replace` \\(default: `false`\\) to define whether the hash should be replaced \\(no new browser history entry\\) or set \\(browser history entry\\)\n\n\n```js\nsap.ui.require([\n    \"sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller\",\n    \"sap/ui/core/UIComponent\", ...\n], function(UIComponent, ...) {\n    \"use strict\";\n    return Controller.extend(\"MyApp.View2\",\n        anyEvent: function() {\n            var oRouter = this.getOwnerComponent().getRouter();\n            oRouter.navTo(\"product\", {\n                id: \"5\",\n                productId: \"3\"\n            });\n        }\n    });\n});\n\n```\n\n\n\n### `display` method\n\nUse this method to navigate to display one or multiple targets. The method uses the target name or an array of target names as only parameter.\n\n\n\n## Events\n\n  \n  \n**Navigation events**\n\n![](images/SAPUI5_Navigation_Events_6f245c0.png \"Navigation events\")\n\n\n\n### Events `RouteMatched` on `Router` and `matched` on `Route`\n\nThese events are fired when a hash matches a route or a pattern. The `routeMatched` event is fired if a pattern of any route in the routing configuration is matched. The `matched` event is fired for a specific route.\n\nIf you want to only react to specific routes, check if the `name` parameter matches the route that you want to listen to. The events have the following parameters:\n\n-   `name` of the route that has been matched\n\n-   `arguments` that are part of the route, mainly the parameters of the hash\n\n-   `config` of the route\n\n\nThe methods `attachRouteMatched` and `attachMatched` can be used to attach an event listener to these events.\n\n```js\nsap.ui.require([\n    \"sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller\",\n    \"sap/ui/core/UIComponent\", ...\n], function(UIComponent, ...) {\n    \"use strict\";\n    return Controller.extend(\"MyApp.View1\", {\n        onInit: function() {\n            var oRouter = this.getOwnerComponent().getRouter();\n            oRouter.getRoute(\"view1\").attachMatched(function(oEvent) {\n                this._selectItemWithId(oEvent.getParameter(\"arguments\").id);\n            }, this);\n        },\n    \n        _selectItemWithId : function(id) {\n            //implementation\n        }\n    });\n});\n```\n\n\n\n### `display` event on `Target`\n\nThis event is fired on the target instance when this target is added and displayed on the UI. The event has the following parameters:\n\n-   `object` for the instance which is displayed; this is either a `View` instance or a `ComponentContainer` instance which wraps the loaded component\n\n-   `control` in which the target object is displayed\n\n-   `config` of the target\n\n-   `data` of the object passed when calling the `display` method\n\n\n\n\n### `created` event on `Views`\n\nThis event is fired on the view/component cache in SAPUI5 routing which can be fetched by calling the `getViews()` method on a router instance every time a new view or component has been created by navigation. The event has the following parameters:\n\n-   `object` for the created instance\n\n-   `options` containing additional options\n\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Tutorial: Navigation and Routing](../03_Get-Started/navigation-and-routing-tutorial-1b6dcd3.md \"SAPUI5 comes with a powerful routing API that helps you control the state of your application efficiently.
