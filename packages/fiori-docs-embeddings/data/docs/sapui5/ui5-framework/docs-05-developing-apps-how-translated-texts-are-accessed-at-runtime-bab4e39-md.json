The following access sequence applies:\n\n    1.  If a text is not available in the requested language, the English text is retrieved.\n\n    2.  If the English text is not available, the text in the default language is retrieved.\n\n    3.  If the text in the default language is not available, the default properties file from the SAPUI5 ABAP repository is retrieved.\n\n\n",
