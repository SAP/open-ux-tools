The name can contain a link that triggers a quick overview of the user's profile data. The actual text written by the user follows the name. The `FeedListItem` control includes the `sap.m.FormattedText` control that enables you to use HTML formatted text.\n\n    For more information about the `FormattedText` control, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.FormattedText) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.FormattedText).\n\n-   **Behavior**\n\n    When the text exceeds a certain number of characters \\(default value can be overwritten by the consuming application\\), the rest of the text is truncated and a *MORE* link appears. Clicking the link shows the entire text, and the link is renamed to *LESS*. Clicking *LESS* collapses the text back to its original truncated length.\n\n-   **Actions**\n\n    Each item in the feed may also include an optional *More* button that provides access to additional actions that the user can perform on this feed item. The actions available for a feed item are specified in its `actions` aggregation and are defined using `FeedListItemAction` elements.\n\n    For more information about the `FeedListItemAction` element, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.FeedListItemAction).\n\n\nThe `sap.m.FeedListItem` control can be used in combination with the `sap.m.FeedInput` control as a feed or notes control. For more information, see [Feed Input](feed-input-0ec25a1.md).\n\n",
