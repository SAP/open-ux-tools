We have also improved other accessibility features of the table, for example, the *Delete* and *Edit* buttons for row actions have become accessible via keyboard. These features have not only been changed for the responsive table, but partly also for `sap.m.List`. Also, the ARIA role has been adapted. We have adapted the related documentation.
