Consider either using `sap.ui.core.HTML` or creating a notepad control instead, both of which can be used in your XML view.\n\nWhen mixing XHTML and SAPUI5 controls, observe the following rules:\n\n-   XHTML elements can be used instead of the SAPUI5 type control, for example, in the root of an XML view or in the content aggregation of a layout container.\n\n-   When embedding XHTML in an aggregation of a SAPUI5 control, the XHTML must not consist of a single text node. The topmost node of an embedded XHTML tree must be an XHTML element. Embedding pure text into an aggregation is not supported.\n\n-   The XHTML nodes are converted 1:1 to HTML, the XML view does not deal with any differences between XHTML and HTML \\(for example rewriting and auto-closing tags\\)\n\n-   The created HTML DOM nodes are preserved during re-rendering of an XML view: Modifications to the DOM are not lost.\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> As an alternative to embedding XHTML, you can use the `sap.ui.core.HTML` control. As this requires content encoding it is, however, less convenient.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Native XHTML can't be used in the binding template for a bound aggregation \\(e.g., the `content` aggregation\\) of the XML view.\n\n\n\n## Procedure\n\nTo mix SAPUI5 controls with native XHTML, you only need the XHTML namespace to use \\(X\\)HTML:\n\n```xml\n<mvc:View controllerName=\"module:sap/hcm/Address\" xmlns=\"sap.m\" xmlns:mvc=\"sap.ui.core.mvc\"\n           xmlns:html=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n   <Panel>\n      <Button text=\"Press Me. I am an SAPUI5 Button\"/>\n      <html:button>No, press me. I am native HTML Button.</html:button>\n   </Panel>\n</mvc:View>\n```\n\n",
