We need to debug the issue and fix it before someone finds out.\n\nLuckily, SAPUI5 provides a couple of debugging tools that we can use within the app to check the application logic and the developer tools of modern browsers are also quite good. We will now check for the root cause.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio50990a077f964958a6e5cef1002e5316__section_chj_s5x_31b\"/>\n\n## Preview\n\n  \n  \n**The diagnostics window**\n\n![The graphic has an explanatory text.](images/UI5_Walkthrough_Step_29a_930de31.png \"The diagnostics window\")\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio50990a077f964958a6e5cef1002e5316__section_dhj_s5x_31b\"/>\n\n## Coding\n\nYou can view all files at [OpenUI5 TypeScript Walkthrough - Step 29: Debugging Tools](https://github.com/sap-samples/ui5-typescript-walkthrough/tree/main/steps/29) and [download the solution as a zip file](https://sap-samples.github.io/ui5-typescript-walkthrough/ui5-typescript-walkthrough-step-29.zip).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio50990a077f964958a6e5cef1002e5316__section_ykp_sth_tyb\"/>\n\n## webapp/view/InvoiceList.view.xml\n\nWe introduce a typo in the binding of the number attribute to simulate a frequent error; instead of using `'invoice>ExtendedPrice'` we use <code>'invoice&gt;Ex<b>T</b>endedPrice'</code>.\n\n```xml\n<mvc:View\n    controllerName=\"ui5.walkthrough.controller.InvoiceList\"\n    xmlns=\"sap.m\"\n    xmlns:core=\"sap.ui.core\"\n    xmlns:mvc=\"sap.ui.core.mvc\">\n\n    <List\n        id=\"invoiceList\"\n        headerText=\"{i18n>invoiceListTitle}\"\n        class=\"sapUiResponsiveMargin\"\n        width=\"auto\"\n        items=\"{\n            path : 'invoice>/Invoices',\n            sorter : {\n                path : 'ShipperName',\n                group : true\n            }\n        }\">\n\n        <headerToolbar>\n            <Toolbar>\n                <Title text=\"{i18n>invoiceListTitle}\" />\n                <ToolbarSpacer />\n                <SearchField\n                    width=\"50%\"\n                    search=\".onFilterInvoices\"/>\n            </Toolbar>\n        </headerToolbar>\n        <items>\n            <ObjectListItem\n                core:require=\"{\n                    Currency: 'sap/ui/model/type/Currency'\n                }\"\n                title=\"{invoice>Quantity} x {invoice>ProductName}\"\n                number=\"{\n                    parts: [\n                        'invoice>ExTendedPrice',\n                        'view>/currency'\n                    ],\n                    type: 'Currency',\n                    formatOptions: {\n                        showMeasure: false\n                    }\n                }\"\n                numberUnit=\"{view>/currency}\"\n                numberState=\"{= ${invoice>ExtendedPrice} > 50 ?

By entering the [shortcut](../02_Read-Me-First/keyboard-shortcuts-for-sapui5-tools-154844c.md) [Ctrl\\] + [Shift\\] + [Alt\\] /[Option\\] + [S\\]  we open the SAPUI5 support diagnostics tool and check the app.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If you use the Google Chrome browser, you can install the *UI5 Inspector* plugin. With this plugin, you can easily debug your SAPUI5- or OpenUI5-based apps. For more information, see [UI5 Inspector](../04_Essentials/ui5-inspector-b24e724.md).\n\nBesides technical information about the app and a trace that is similar to the developer tools console of the browser, there is a really handy tool for checking such errors in this dialog. Open the tab *Control Tree* by clicking on the expand symbol on the right.\n\nA hierarchical tree of SAPUI5 controls is shown on the left and the properties of the selected control are displayed on the right. If we now select the first `ObjectListItem` control of the tree and go to the *Binding Infos* tab on the right, we can actually see that the binding path of the number attribute is marked as invalid. We can now correct the error in the view and the price should appear in the list of invoices again.\n\nSometimes errors are not as easy to spot and you actually need to debug the JavaScript code with the tools of the browser.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> When debugging UI5 applications that use built resources, the SAPUI5 files are minified, which means that variable names are shortened and comments are removed.\n> \n> This makes debugging harder, because the code is a lot less readable. You can load the debug sources by adding the URL parameter `sap-ui-debug=true` or by pressing [Ctrl\\] + [Shift\\] + [Alt\\] /[Option\\] + [P\\]  and selecting *Use Debug Sources* in the dialog box that is displayed. After reloading the page, you can see in the *Network* tab of the browser's developer tools that now a lot of files are loaded that have a `â€“dbg` suffix. These are the source code files that include comments and the uncompressed code of the app and the SAPUI5 artifacts.\n\n  \n  \n**Technical information dialog**\n\n![Displays general information about the application, UI5,, and user browser](images/UI5_Walkthrough_Step_29b_34c4b02.png \"Technical information dialog \")\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of the SAPUI5 support tools, go through the [Troubleshooting Tutorial](troubleshooting-tutorial-5661952.md) tutorial.\n\nIf you're stuck and need help for some development task, you can also post a question in the SAPUI5-related forums, for example in the [SAP Community](https://www.sap.com/community/topic/ui5.html) or on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=sapui5).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio50990a077f964958a6e5cef1002e5316__section_lvc_gkw_31b\"/>\n\n## Conventions\n\n-   As per SAPUI5 convention uncompressed source files end with `*-dbg.js`\n\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Debugging](../04_Essentials/debugging-c9b0f8c.md#loioc9b0f8cca852443f9b8d3bf8ba5626ab \"When developing apps, searching for bugs is an inevitable part of the process.
