We can easily do this with OPA5, a feature of SAPUI5 that is easy to set up and is based on JavaScript and QUnit. Using integration and unit tests and running them consistently in a continuous integration \\(CI\\) environment, we can make sure that we don't accidentally break our app or introduce logical errors in existing code.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> In this tutorial, we focus on a simple use case for the test implementation. If you want to learn more about OPA tests, have a look at our [Testing Tutorial](testing-tutorial-291c912.md) tutorial, especially [Step 6: A First OPA Test](step-6-a-first-opa-test-1b47457.md).\n\n\n\n## Preview\n\n  \n  \n**An OPA test opens the \"Hello\" dialog from step 16**\n\n![The graphic has an explanatory text.](images/UI5_Walkthrough_Step_28_250d5b9.png \"An OPA test opens the \"Hello\" dialog from step 16\")\n\n\n\n## Coding\n\nYou can view and download all files at [Walkthrough - Step 28](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.tutorial.walkthrough/sample/sap.m.tutorial.walkthrough.28).\n\n  \n  \n**Folder Structure for this Step**\n\n![The graphic has an explanatory text.](images/SAPUI5_Walkthrough_Step_28_2_72406ab.png \"Folder Structure for this Step\")\n\nWe add a new folder `integration` below the `test` folder, where we put our new test cases. Page objects that help structuring such integration tests are put in the `pages` subfolder that we also create now.\n\n\n\n## webapp/test/integration/NavigationJourney.js \\(New\\)\n\n```js\nsap.ui.define([\n\t\"sap/ui/test/opaQunit\",\n\t\"./pages/App\"\n], (opaTest) => {\n\t\"use strict\";\n\n\tQUnit.module(\"Navigation\");\n\n\topaTest(\"Should open the Hello dialog\", (Given, When, Then) => {\n\t\t// Arrangements\n\t\tGiven.iStartMyUIComponent({\n\t\t\tcomponentConfig: {\n\t\t\t\tname: \"ui5.walkthrough\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t});\n\n\t\t//Actions\n\t\tWhen.onTheAppPage.iPressTheSayHelloWithDialogButton();\n\n\t\t// Assertions\n\t\tThen.onTheAppPage.iShouldSeeTheHelloDialog();\n\n\t\t// Cleanup\n\t\tThen.iTeardownMyApp();\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nLet's start with the `journey` first. A `journey` consists of a series of integration tests that belong to the same context such as navigating through the app. Similar to the QUnit test implementation, OPA5 uses QUnit, that's why we first set up a QUnit module `Navigation` that will be displayed on our result page.\n\nThe function `opaTest` is the main aspect for defining integration tests with OPA. Its parameters define a test name and a callback function that gets executed with the following OPA5 helper objects to write meaningful tests that read like a user story.\n\n-   `Given`\n\n    On the given object we can call arrangement functions like `iStartMyUIComponent` to load our app component for integration testing.\n\n-   `When`\n\n    Contains custom actions that we can execute to get the application in a state where we can test the expected behavior.\n\n-   `Then`\n\n    Contains custom assertions that check a specific constellation in the application and the teardown function that removes our component again.\n\n\nIn our journey, we create a very simple test that starts the app. Inside the app, we simulate a click on a button and expect that the dialog is opened afterwards. Finally, we shut down the app again.\n\nAs you can see, the test case reads like a user story, we actually do not need the implementation of the methods yet to understand the meaning of the test case. This approach is called \"Behavior Driven Development\" or simply BDD and is popular in \"Agile Software Development\".\n\n\n\n## webapp/test/integration/pages/App.js \\(New\\)\n\n```js\nsap.ui.define([\n\t\"sap/ui/test/Opa5\",\n\t\"sap/ui/test/actions/Press\"\n], (Opa5, Press) => {\n\t\"use strict\";\n\n\tconst sViewName = \"ui5.walkthrough.view.HelloPanel\";\n\n\tOpa5.createPageObjects({\n\t\tonTheAppPage: {\n\t\t\tactions: {\n\t\t\t\tiPressTheSayHelloWithDialogButton() {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn this.waitFor({\n\t\t\t\t\t\tid: \"helloDialogButton\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\tviewName: sViewName,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactions: new Press(),\n\t\t\t\t\t\terrorMessage: \"Did not find the 'Say Hello With Dialog' button on the HelloPanel view\"\n\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t},\n\n\t\t\tassertions: {\n\t\t\t\tiShouldSeeTheHelloDialog() {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn this.waitFor({\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrolType: \"sap.m.Dialog\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuccess() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// we set the view busy, so we need to query the parent of the app\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpa5.assert.ok(true, \"The dialog is open\");\n\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\terrorMessage: \"Did not find the dialog control\"\n\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nThe implementation of the page object holds the helper functions we just called in our `journey`. We require OPA5 from the `sap.ui.test` namespace and define a page object with the helper function `createPageObjects`. We pass in an object with the key of our page `onTheAppPage` and two sections: `actions` and `assertions`.\n\nIn the actions section of the page object we define a function to click the \"Hello\" dialog button. This is done in OPA5 with a `waitFor` statement, it is basically a loop that checks for the conditions defined as parameters. If the conditions are met, the success callback is executed, if the test fails because the conditions have not been met, the text in the `errorMessage` property is displayed on the result page.\n\nIn the assertions section we define a `waitFor` statement that checks if a `sap.m.Dialog` control is existing in the DOM of the app. When the dialog has been found, the test is successful and we can immediately confirm by calling an `ok` statement with a meaningful message.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio9bf4dce43b7943d0909cd6c58a933589__section_srf_xpc_yfb\"/>\n\n## webapp/test/integration/opaTests.qunit.js \\(New\\)\n\nWe create a new `opaTests.qunit.js` file under `webapp/test/integration/`.\n\nThis module imports our `NavigationJourney` and is the entrypoint for all integration tests in the project.\n\n```js\nsap.ui.define([\n    \"./NavigationJourney\"\n]);\n```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio9bf4dce43b7943d0909cd6c58a933589__section_trf_xpc_yfb\"/>\n\n## webapp/test/testsuite.qunit.js\n\nFinally we reference the new `integration/opaTests.qunit.js` in the `testsuite.qunit.js` file. The `.qunit.js` extension is omitted and will be added automatically during runtime.\n\n```js\nsap.ui.define(() => {\n\t    \"use strict\";\n\t    return {\n\t\t      // ...\n\t\t      tests: {\n\t\t\t        \"unit/unitTests\": {\n\t\t\t\t           title: \"UI5 Walkthrough - Unit Tests\"\n\t\t\t        },\n\t\t\t        \"integration/opaTests\": {\n\t\t\t\t           title: \"UI5 Walkthrough - Integration Tests\"\n\t\t\t        }\n\t\t     }\n\t   };\n});\n```\n\nIf we now open the `webapp/test/testsuite.qunit.html` file in the browser and select `integration/opaTests`, the QUnit layout should appear and a test \"Should see the Hello dialog\" will run immediately. This action will load the app component on the right side of the page. There you can see the operations the test is performing on the app. If everything works correctly, a button click will be triggered, then a dialog will be displayed and the test case will be green.\n\n\n\n## Conventions\n\n-   OPA tests are located in the `webapp/test/integration` folder of the application.\n\n-   Use `page` objects and `journeys` for structuring OPA tests.\n\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Integration Testing with One Page Acceptance Tests \\(OPA5\\)](../04_Essentials/integration-testing-with-one-page-acceptance-tests-opa5-2696ab5.md \"OPA5 is an API for SAPUI5 controls.
