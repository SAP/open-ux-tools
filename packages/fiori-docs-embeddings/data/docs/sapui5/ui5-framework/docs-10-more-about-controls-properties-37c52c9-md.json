This property accepts an enumeration from `sap.m.SwipeDirection?` with the following values:\n\n-   `LeftToRight?`: Swipe from left to right\n-   `RightToLeft?`: Swipe from right to left\n-   `Both`: Both directions \\(left to right, or right to left\\)\n\nThe default value is `Both`, but in some use cases we recommend that you change this property, for example to prevent swipe conflicts.\n\n",
