However, there are certain UX patterns that are considered as optimal and are recommended for SAP Fiori apps. The `FlexibleColumnLayoutSemanticHelper` class helps you implement them by giving you tips about what layout to display when.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Using this class is NOT mandatory in order to build an app with the `FlexibleColumnLayout`, but makes it easier to achieve the optimal UX recommended in the SAP Fiori design guidelines.\n\nThe first 3 logical levels of information are displayed in the three columns side by side, and the forth \\(and others\\) are displayed in the `End` column in fullscreen. If at any time the user opens a page in fullscreen, all subsequent levels are also displayed in fullscreen.\n\nHere is a short overview of some of the rules of the default rule set:\n\n-   The control starts with `OneColumn` layout \\(usually to display a list of items\\).\n\n-   When the user selects an item from the `Begin` column, the item's details are displayed in the `Mid` column and the layout should change to `TwoColumnsBeginExpanded`. Two action buttons are displayed on the page in the `Mid` column – *Fullscreen* and *Close*.\n\n    -   Choosing the *Close* button changes the layout back to `OneColumn`.\n\n    -   Choosing the *Fullscreen* button changes the layout to `MidColumnFullScreen`. The *Fullscreen* button is then replaced with an *ExitFullscreen* button, which restores the layout to `TwoColumnsBeginExpanded`.\n\n\n-   If the user selects an item from the `Mid` column:\n\n    -   If the current layout is `TwoColumnsBeginExpanded`/`TwoColumnsMidExpanded`, the layout changes to `ThreeColumnsMidExpanded`. The *Close* and *Fullscreen* buttons should now be displayed only in the `End` column.\n\n    -   If the current layout is `MidColumnFullScreen`, the layout changes to `EndColumnFullScreen`.\n\n\n-   If the user selects an item from the `End` column \\(which represents the third logical level of information\\), the layout should change to `EndColumnFullScreen` and the forth \\(then fifth, etc.\\) logical level should again be displayed in the `End` column.\n\n\n",
