For example, if you'd like to disable SAPUI5 flexibility during SAPUI5 bootstrap, set the value of the `flexibilityServices` parameter to an empty string. Here's an example\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ```\n> <script\n>     id=\"sap-ui-bootstrap\"\n>     src=resources/sap-ui-core.js       \n> \n>     data-sap-ui-flexibilityServices=\"\"\n>     data-sap-ui-preload=\"async\" >\n> </script>\n> \n> ```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio642dab291a7b47ec9d46c39b3c482aba__section_dwl_nbf_pkb\"/>\n\n## Using Connectors\n\nFor various use cases, you can also define a list of connectors within `flexibilityServices`. These connectors are targeted at a specific use case and can be combined.\n\nYou provide the list of connectors as a string, because `flexibilityServices` is a string as well. Example: `flexibilityServices ='[{\"connector\": \"SessionStorageConnector\"}]'`.\n\n\n\n### Configuring the Connectors for Layering\n\nThe connectors control the layers to which changes are written. Every connector has a default layering configuration, but you can limit this default by specifying certain layers. Example: As a result of the following string, only the SessionStorage connector is used for CUSTOMER layer content \\(see [Layering Concept](layering-concept-9e63057.md)\\):\n\n`flexibilityServices ='[{\"connector\": \"SessionStorageConnector\", layers: [\"CUSTOMER\"]}]'`\n\n\n\n### Connectors for Productive Usage\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nName\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nSupported Layers\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nDescription\n\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`BtpServiceConnector`\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`CUSTOMER, PUBLIC, USER`\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nUsed to connect key user adaptation, shared views, **and end-user personalization** on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment.\n\nFor more information, see [Developing Applications Running Standalone](https://help.sap.com/docs/UI5_FLEXIBILITY_KEY_USER/0f8b49c4dfc94bc0bda25a19aa93d5b2/7f1c8c8aa7e1487a9d79a0b001e8060b.html/?&version=Cloud#adding-sapui5-flexibility-services-to-the-sapui5-bootstrap).\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`KeyUserConnector` \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`CUSTOMER, PUBLIC`\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n> ### Caution:  \n> .\n> \n> If you develop apps running standalone on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment, we strongly recommend that you replace the `KeyUserConnector` with the `BtpServiceConnector` in your SAPUI5 bootstrap.\n\nUsed to connect key user adaptation and shared views on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment.\n\nFor more information, see [Developing Applications Running in the SAP Cloud Portal Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/UI5_FLEXIBILITY_KEY_USER/0f8b49c4dfc94bc0bda25a19aa93d5b2/55433c585c5a43ef96d9b8d4bc4bc464.html/?&version=Cloud#adding-sapui5-flexibility-services-to-the-sapui5-bootstrap).\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n### Connectors Used by SAP - Not for Public Usage\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nName\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nSupported Layers\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nDescription\n\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`LrepConnector`\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`CUSTOMER, PUBLIC, USER`\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nDefault connector used to handle ABAP back-end systems as well as SAP BTP, Neo environment\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`PersonalizationConnector`\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`USER`\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nUsed to connect personalization within an SAPUI5 application on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n### Connectors for Testing and Demo Purposes\n\n> ### Note:  \n> To apply the mocked data correctly, you need a dependency to the `sap.ui.fl` library.
