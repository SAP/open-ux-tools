You can use the dropdown menus to filter on *Severity*, *Category*, or *Audience*. You can clear your filtering by choosing *Clear Filtering* \\(![](../01_Whats-New/images/Clear_filter_icon_4a0cf3b.png)\\).\n\nSelecting *Report* generates an HTML report with the current set of rules and scope. You can view it in a new tab or download it as a `.ZIP` file.\n\n\n\n## Issue Details\n\nThe middle part shows a detailed view of the selected rule. It contains the following:\n\n-   Description - general description of the rule\n\n-   Resolution - steps to resolve the issue\n\n-   URLs - useful links \\(for example, API Reference or Documentation\\)\n\n-   Severity - the severity of the identified issue\n\n-   Element ClassName and ID - the namespace of the element\n\n\n\n\n## Element Tree\n\nThe right side shows the element tree of the application. The root of the tree is called `<WEBPAGE>`. All rules that are not specific for a given control are mapped to this element. If these rules are triggered, the resulting issues will be mapped to the `<WEBPAGE>` element.\n\n-   Hovering on an element in the tree highlights it in the application \\(if it is visible\\).\n\n-   Selecting an element with issues in the element tree loads those issues in the issues list.\n\n-   The table in the issues list shows all other elements that have triggered the same rule. The list also shows you the severity of each issue.\n\n\n  \n  \n**Support Assistant DOM Tree**\n\n![](images/Support_Assistant_DOM_Tree_4c280d1.png \"Support Assistant DOM Tree\")\n\n",
