To add further CSS classes to SAPUI5 controls, use the `class` attribute.\n\n\n\n## Context\n\n> ### Caution:  \n> Deprecated as of SAPUI5 version 1.120. Refer to an external style sheet instead.\n\n> ### Tip:  \n> We recommend to carefully choose the elements that you style as the CSS always affects the whole page and is **not** restricted to the view.\n\n\n\n## Procedure\n\nHere's how you would add a style definition and define a button that uses it in an XML view:\n\n```xml\n\n<mvc:View controllerName=\"module:sap/hcm/Address\" xmlns=\"sap.m\" xmlns:mvc=\"sap.ui.core.mvc\"\n           xmlns:html=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n   <html:style>\n      .mySuperRedButton {\n         color: red;\n      }\n   </html:style>\n   <Panel>\n      <Button class=\"mySuperRedButton\" text=\"Press Me\"/>\n   </Panel>\n</mvc:View>\n```\n\n> ### Note:  \n> To allow your view to be used in an environment with a Content Security Policy denying inline styles \\(i.e. without the `unsafe-inline` source for the `style-src` directive\\), you need to refer to an external style sheet instead of embedding the style sheet into your XML view. For more information, see the Walkthrough tutorial, [Step 14: Custom CSS and Theme Colors](../03_Get-Started/step-14-custom-css-and-theme-colors-723f4b2.md).\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The XML view offers special handling for style classes. You can specify them via the `class` attribute on a control's XML node. Please be aware that this attribute is not a property of the respective control and thus is not supported by a control's constructor.\n\nTo refer to a style class in JavaScript, for example in a controller, use the `addStyleClass` method on a control:\n\n```js\n    myButton.addStyleClass(\"mySuperRedButton\");\n```\n\nand add the style definition to your CSS file.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[API Reference: `sap.ui.core.Control#addStyleClass`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Control%23methods/addStyleClass)\n\n[API Reference: `sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView)\n\n",
