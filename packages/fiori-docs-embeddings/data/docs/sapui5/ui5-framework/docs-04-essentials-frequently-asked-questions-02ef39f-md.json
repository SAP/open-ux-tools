You also need to set the QUnit timeout \\(to a time equal to or greater than the OPA5 setting\\), otherwise QUnit might give up early:\n\n```js\nsap.ui.test.Opa.config.timeout = 20; // wait time in seconds\nQUnit.config.testTimeout = 20000; // wait time in milliseconds\n```\n\n\n\n## Who should write feature files?\n\nIdeally, the Product Owner develops feature files together with developers. Depending on how familiar Product Owners are with the tool, they can upload the feature files directly to source control, or let the developers do the upload.\n\n\n\n## How can I avoid inadequacies when writing the step definitions?\n\nYou may find that there is a gap between what the Product Owner has written, and the information that the developer requires to implement an integration test. Developers can modify the feature file to enable testing, as long as they check back with the Product Owner to ensure that the feature file is still correct.\n\n\n\n## Every time the Product Owner modifies the feature file, it breaks the tests How can I avoid this?\n\nActually, this is the point of Gherkin. When modifications to a feature file are uploaded to source control, we expect this to break existing tests, since the application's expected behavior has changed — but the application itself has not changed yet. Gherkin is forcing the application to stay in sync with the feature file. Consider that this also encourages you to be more honest about accepting new feature changes into your product — and the amount of extra work that this entails. We recommend that you use your formal code review process to allow developers to change the application and fix the tests, and then submit all the new code together with the feature file changes at the same time into the main branch.\n\n",
