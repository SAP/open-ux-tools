Generic actions\n\n    Examples: *Save* and *Edit*\n\n2.  Application-specific actions\n\n    They follow the order defined in the metadata.\n\n3.  Manifest-based custom actions\n\n    For more information on manifest-based custom actions, see [Adding Custom Actions Using Extension Points](adding-custom-actions-using-extension-points-7619517.md).\n\n4.  *Related Apps* button\n\n5.  Other generic actions\n\n    Example: *Share* functionality\n\n\n\n\n## Display Based on Mode\n\nThe display of actions depends on which mode the user is in:\n\n-   In *Display* mode, the relevant actions are displayed in the header toolbar \\(see [Object Page Elements](object-page-elements-645e27a.md)\\).\n\n-   In *Edit* or *Create* mode, the footer bar contains the relevant actions, for example, *Save* and *Cancel* in *Edit* mode \\(see the mentioned figure\\), and *Create* and *Cancel* in *Create* mode.\n\n\n  \n  \n**Object Page: Action Triggered from Footer Bar \\(Edit Mode\\)**\n\n![](images/Object_Page_Footer_Bar_Edit_Mode_2c8767f.png \"Object Page: Action Triggered from Footer Bar (Edit Mode)\")\n\nYou can add criticality to an action button via annotations. For more information, see [Setting the Criticality for Actions](setting-the-criticality-for-actions-12f2ba2.md).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiof65e8b196335457cbfc891418ec25cfd__section_ayc_fnz_qsb\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4\n\nIf an application has set the criticality for an action, that is, if app developers have defined semantic actions, these are automatically placed first. This means semantic actions are placed before generic actions \\(like *Save* and *Edit*\\) and in this case the generic actions are no longer automatically emphasized.\n\n\n\n### Changing the Order of Action Buttons Specified by an Application\n\nYou can change the order of action buttons for both manifest-based actions and annotation-based actions. To do so, use `\"position\"` to define the placement of your action. For more information, see the *Additional Features in SAP Fiori elements for OData V4* section in [Adding Custom Actions Using Extension Points](adding-custom-actions-using-extension-points-7619517.md).\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Enabling Actions in the Object Page Header](enabling-actions-in-the-object-page-header-5fe4396.md \"You can enable generic actions in your object header.\")\n\n[Adding Action Buttons to Forms in Sections](adding-action-buttons-to-forms-in-sections-e64efda.md \"You can add action buttons to the forms contained in sections.
