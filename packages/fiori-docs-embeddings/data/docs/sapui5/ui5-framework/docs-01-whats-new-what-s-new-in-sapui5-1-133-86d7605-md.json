We have adapted the menu to make it more accessible and provided a leaner design by using icons for the quick actions instead of buttons. In addition, there is now a *Table Settings* button taking the user to the *View Settings* dialog with the personalization settings.

This button appears on top of the other fixed items in the static footer area and can be used for quick access to frequently used actions. Moreover, parent-side navigation items now can either be dual or single click areas; non-selectable items behave as single click areas and can expand to list any child items. Lastly, a new `press` event is added for action item types.

The button is now always positioned at the right end of the footer, with precedence over any other preexisting buttons. We have provided an optional setting to hide the button if it is not needed. This new feature is backward compatible but generates a footer if none exists. For more information, see the [Documentation](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/footer).\n-   We have introduced a new `overflow` property for cards with a fixed height. If set to `ShowMore`, a shading gradient overlay marks the borderline over which any content is cut due to overflowing the card's fixed height. Additionally, a *Show More* button automatically appears and enables the user to open the entire card in a new window and read its full content.

Note that we haven't taken over the changed default calendar of the `ar_SA` locale for now. Locale-specific texts for deprecated IANA time zones have been removed from the CLDR data.\n\n-   We have introduced a mapping of deprecated IANA time zones to current IANA time zones in`sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat`. Deprecated time zones supplied to the `format` function are mapped and a locale-specific text for the current time zone is provided instead. When parsing time zones, deprecated time zone keys are mapped accordingly. For more information, see *Mapping of Deprecated Time Zones* in [Parameters](../04_Essentials/date-format-91f2eba.md#loio91f2eba36f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_params).\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.133</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2025-02-20\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.133 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**\n\nWe now support the creation of entities for single-valued navigation properties.
