In this section you can find tips on how to recognize and resolve some of these cases.\n\n\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nSupport Assistant Behavior\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nRoot Cause\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nSolution\n\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nWhat does it mean when the following errors appear in the browser console?\n\n\"Access to XMLHttpRequest at <URL\\> from origin <ORIGIN\\> has been blocked by the CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.\"\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nThis usually happens when serving SAPUI5 from a different origin. The Support Assistant tries to load support rule definitions from there, but cannot load them - a 404 response is sent by the origin server. The issue is usually caused by missing or misconfigured CORS headers on the 404 response specifically. Besides some support rules not being loaded, this should not affect normal operation of Support Assistant.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSAPUI5 library owners are encouraged to provide a `.supportrc` as specified by Support Assistant documentation to avoid causing 404 responses.\n\nFor more information, see [Create a Ruleset for a Library](create-a-ruleset-for-a-library-b5a5135.md) and [Content Security Policy](../05_Developing_Apps/content-security-policy-fe1a6db.md).\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nWhen you choose a custom location, you get an error message: 'The syntax of the location address is incorrect. The correct syntax is ... '.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nURL doesn't match the protocol of the application.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nIf the application is HTTP, the location should also be HTTP. If it is HTTPS, the location should be HTTPS. Also, the URL should end in sap/ui/support/.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nTemporary rules are not available in the current environment due to Content Security Policy \\(CSP\\) restrictions.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nContent Security Policy is forbidding the execution of temporary rules.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nRun the Support Assistant in a development environment, where the `script-src` directive is set to `unsafe-eval`. For more information about CSP, see [Content Security Policy](../05_Developing_Apps/content-security-policy-fe1a6db.md).\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n",
