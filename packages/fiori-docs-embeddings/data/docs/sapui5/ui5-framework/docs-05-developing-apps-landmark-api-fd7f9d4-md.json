Landmarks help assistive technology users to orient themselves in a page and help them navigate easily to various sections within a page. Landmarks also provide an easy way for assistive technology users to skip over blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages and inform them of the structure of a page. For instance, if there is a common navigation menu found on every page, landmarks can be used to skip over it and navigate from one section to another.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiofd7f9d41ca9c46d891c45f1dcc0682bf__section_vft_ghf_fqb\"/>\n\n## Landmark APIs in SAPUI5\n\nSupport for landmark roles is provided for:\n\n-   `sap.f.DynamicPage`\n\n-   `sap.m.Page`\n-   `sap.m.Panel`\n-   `sap.uxap.ObjectPage`\n-   `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout`\n\nBefore seeing how a landmark is set for these controls, you must understand which landmark roles we can use.\n\nThe picture below is an example of different landmarks with assigned labels in a `sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout`. ![](images/Landmark_Info_Image_77cb16f.png)\n\nSupported landmark roles in SAPUI5 are stored in the `sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole` enum. For more information, see the [API Reference: `sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole). \n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiofd7f9d41ca9c46d891c45f1dcc0682bf__section_jx5_b5b_jqb\"/>\n\n## sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole\n\nHere is a list of all of the values of the enum showing the part of the web page for which each of them is appropriate:\n\n`sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole:`\n\n-   `sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole.Banner`: Represents the ARIA [`banner`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#banner) role.\n\n    A region that contains the prime heading or internal title of a page.\n\n-   `sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole.Complementary`: Represents the ARIA [`complementary`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#complementary) role.\n\n    Any section of the document that supports the main content, yet is separate and meaningful on its own.\n\n-   `sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole.ContentInfo`: Represents the ARIA [`complementary`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#complementary) role.\n\n    A region that contains information about the parent document such as copyrights and links to privacy statements.\n\n-   `sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole.Form`: Represents the ARIA [`form` role.](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#form)\n\n    A region of the document that represents a collection of form-associated elements, some of which can represent editable values that can be submitted to a server for processing.\n\n-   `sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole.Main`: Represents the ARIA [`main` role.](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#main)\n\n    The main content in a document. In almost all cases, a page will have only one `role=\"main\"`.\n\n-   `sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole.Navigation`: Represents the ARIA [`navigation` role.](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#navigation)\n\n    A collection of links suitable for use when navigating the document or related documents.\n\n-   `sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole.Region`: Represents the ARIA [`region` role.](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#region)\n\n    A collection of links suitable for use when navigating the document or related documents.\n\n-   `sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole.Search`: Represents the ARIA [`search` role.](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#search)\n\n    The search tool of a web document.\n\n-   `sap.ui.core.AccessibleLandmarkRole.None`: No explicit role is applicable.\n\n    The interpretation of this value depends on the control/element that defines a property with this type. Normally this value means that no accessible landmark should be written.\n\n\n",
