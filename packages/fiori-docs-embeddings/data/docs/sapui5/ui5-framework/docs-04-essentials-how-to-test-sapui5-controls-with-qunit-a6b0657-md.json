Readability is more important than performance. You don't have to write a reuse for everything. It's ok to repeat yourself in unit tests if it helps readability.\n-   Don't test too many internal aspects: try to test the control like an application or user will use it.\n-   You have to find a balance between not stubbing / expecting too much of the internal aspects and not doing it at all. If you tightly couple your test to the implementation, maintenance will be a pain.\n-   If your test is too long, you're squeezing too much stuff into one of your control's functions. Divide the complexity, then your test will be simpler and your productive code will be better.\n-   Don't test general SAPUI5 functionality. Only test things actually done by your control \\(see \"What Should You Test?\" below\\).\n-   Never write an `if` in a test. It is a sign that you're either not stubbing correctly or you're testing multiple things in one test.\n-   Use the `expect` QUnit statement to specify how many assertions are expected. You should always write your test in a way that every assertion will be executed. This is especially important if you want to test asynchronous behavior. Using `expect` helps you find out if all asynchronous operations have been resolved and all expected code paths have been passed.\n-   Whenever you encounter a Bug/Ticket, start by writing a QUnit that fails first, and *then* fix the code.\n-   Write your tests as small as possible: don't add a statement that is not needed for the test, such as an ID in the control's constructor properties.\n-   Use fake timers to avoid as many async tests as possible.\n-   Don't test the exact same thing multiple times.\n-   Use modules for grouping your tests: this will give you a better organizational test setup.\n-   You may use modules for `beforeEach/afterEach`, but don't overuse this feature. If you have a longer module, you might not see what the test does because you don't know its setup.\n-   It's sometimes better to write code multiple times.\n-   Don't set up your system being tested in the `beforeEach/afterEach`. It is very rare that all tests in a module have the same constructor. Furthermore, using a global constructor object is dangerous.\n\nIf you stick to these rules, you will find it much easier to refactor/maintain your tests. Keeping the tests atomic will make debugging much easier, because you will hit your breakpoints for the code being tested only. If you write QUnits without keeping to these rules, you may well not notice anything bad to begin with, but you **will** eventually end up in the middle of a maintenance nightmare!\n\n\n\n## Arrange Act Assert Pattern\n\nInternally, we use three templates for testing. The one shown below is the general control template.\n\nUse the following pattern to structure your tests. If everyone sticks to this same pattern, you will be able to read your colleagues' tests very quickly:\n\n```js\n\nQUnit.test(\"Should do Something\", function (assert) { \n    // Arrange\n    \n    // System under Test\n    var oMyControl = new nameSpace.myControl({\n    });\n    \n    // Act\n    \n    // Assert\n\n    // Cleanup\n    oMyControl.destroy();\n});\n```\n\n\n\n### Arrange\n\nIn `Arrange`, you should set up the dependencies and options you need for your `System under Test`.\n\nExamples:\n\n-   The constructor object of your control\n-   Sinon spies/stubs and mocks \\(dependencies of your System under Test\\)\n-   Model\n\n\n\n### System under test\n\nIn `System under Test`, you should create your control and you should also render it if you want to test the rendering.\n\n\n\n### Act\n\nIdeally, this part is only one single line of code executing the function you want to test.\n\n\n\n### Assert\n\nThis part may contain multiple statements of QUnit assertions, but ideally not too many in total.\n\nMake sure that you also test negative paths, not only the expected ones.\n\n\n\n### Optional: Cleanup\n\nHere you should destroy all the controls/models you created.\n\nIf you don't use Sinon sandboxes, revert all the spies/stubs/mocks.\n\n\n\n## What Should You Test?\n\n-   Test all the public functions you introduced.\n-   Test all the overwritten getters and setters.\n-   Test your control's events and how often they are called.\n-   Test all possible user interactions \\(tap, keyboard, focus\\).\n-   You could test how often your control gets rerendered when interacting with it, but only if you are worried that it might be rerenderd too often or not at all.\n-   Test RTL if you have special things done in javascript.\n-   Write some integration tests if you have a composite control \\(don't cover 100% of your child controls - that's overkill and child controls will be hard to maintain\\).\n-   You may test default values of properties, since we cannot change them backwards afterwards and a test will recognize this.\n-   Test how your control interacts with models \\(OData + Json\\).\n-   Test the destruction of your control when working with composites, test if all dependencies/events are unbound on destruction.\n\n\n\n## What Should You NOT Test?\n\n-   Never test non-overwritten getters and setters \\(these are tested in the core of the framework\\).\n-   Never test your complete CSS with computed styles: just check if the classes are set correctly. Focus on testing JavaScript.\n-   Never test other generic framework functionality. Focus on your control.\n\n\n\n## Pitfalls\n\n\n\n### Sinon fake timers\n\nUsing fake timers can be error-prone. Fake timers should only be used with care in specific scenarios. In order to avoid pitfalls using fake timers, see the following documentation:\n\n-   For general information: [Fake Timers](sinon-js-spies-stubs-mocks-faked-timers-and-xhr-457eaad.md#loio457eaada68a24187858fd5e8b21a4892__section_FAKETIM)\n\n-   For using fake timers in combination with rendering: [Rendering and Re-rendering Controls Within Tests](cookbook-for-testing-controls-with-qunit-0ddcc60.md#loio0ddcc60b05ee40dea1a3be09e8fee8f7__section_REREN)\n\n\n\n### I've set a property on my control: Why aren't the changes in the DOM?\n\nThe most likely reason for this is that it didn't wait for the `sap/ui/test/utils/nextUIUpdate` Promise. SAPUI5 does not render synchronously, but waiting for the Promise will proceed the test after the rendering is done.\n\nFor more information, see [Rendering and Re-rendering Controls Within Tests](cookbook-for-testing-controls-with-qunit-0ddcc60.md#loio0ddcc60b05ee40dea1a3be09e8fee8f7__section_REREN)\n\n",
