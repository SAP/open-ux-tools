This event is fired before the `swipeContent` is shown and contains the following three important parameters:\n\n-   `listItem`: List item that fired the swipe event\n-   `swipeContent`: Specifies the `swipeContent` control to be shown on the right-hand side of a list item\n-   `srcControl`: Specifies the control that fired the swipe event\n\nThis means that you can dynamically change the swipe content according to the respective list item. If a list item has not yet been approved, for example, then the *Approve* button is shown. After approval or if it is already approved, the *Disapprove* button is shown. See the following example:\n\n```js\n\n<List \n    id=... \n    swipe=\"handleSwipe\" ... >\n    ...\n    <swipeContent>\n      <Button\n        text=\"Approve Item\"\n        type=\"Accept\"\n        press=\"handleApprove\" />\n    </swipeContent>\n  </List>\n\n```\n\nAnd this is how it looks in the controller:\n\n```js\n\nhandleSwipe: function(e) {   // register swipe event\n        var oSwipeListItem = e.getParameter(\"listItem\"),    // get swiped list item from event\n            oSwipeContent = e.getParameter(\"swipeContent\"); // get swiped content from event\n\n        // Check swiped list item if it is already approved or not\n        if (oSwipeListItem.data(\"approved\")) {    \n            // List item is approved, change swipeContent(button) text to Disapprove and type to Reject\n            oSwipeContent.setText(\"Disapprove\").setType(\"Reject\");  \n        } else  {\n            // List item is not approved, change swipeContent(button) text to Approve and type to Accept\n            oSwipeContent.setText(\"Approve\").setType(\"Accept\");     \n        }\n    },\n\n```\n\nSwipe events can be cancelled. The built-in controls that work with swipe left events like `Switch` or `Slider` cancel a swipe event by default. If you also want to disable swipe events for your custom use case, you can call the `preventDefault` method of the event object, as shown in the following example:\n\n```js\n\nhandleSwipe : function(e) {\n         // get which control inside the list item fired swipe event\n        var oSrcControl = e.getParameter(\"srcControl\");\n\n        // check if the event is coming from Input\n        if (oSrcControl instanceof sap.m.Input) {\n            e.preventDefault();   // cancel swipe\n        }\n    },\n    ...\n\n```\n\n",
