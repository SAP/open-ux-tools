Method names starting with `on` are reserved for event handler methods.\n\nFor common events, such as `click` or `keydown`, it is sufficient to add a handler method. These events are defined in the module `sap/ui/events/ControlEvents`. As SAPUI5 core automatically registers browser event handlers for these methods, they are called automatically. SAPUI5 core also fires events with a richer semantic meaning, so that control developers do not need to check various keycodes.\n\n```js\nonclick: function(oEvent) {\n   alert(\"Control \" + this.getId() + \" was clicked.\");\n}\n```\n\nThere are also SAPUI5-specific event handlers, which can be used for reacting on specific situations. These are `onBeforeRendering`, `onAfterRendering`, `onlocalizationChanged` \\(note the lower case 'l'\\), and `onThemeChanged`.\n\nInternally used events, which start with \"sap\", are defined in the `sap/ui/events/PseudoEvent` module. An example is the `sapnext` event, which is triggered by \"arrow down\" or \"arrow right\" \\(or \"arrow left\" in right-to-left mode\\). The `sapnext` event performs all checks that are required to check whether the user wants to navigate to the next item. The `event` object that is passed to the handler method contains more information. These methods are private methods and must only be called by SAPUI5 core.\n\n```js\nonsapnext: function(events) {\n   // navigate to next item, an arrow key was pressed\n}\n```\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[API Reference: `ControlEvents`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/module%3Asap%2Fui%2Fevents%2FControlEvents)\n\n[API Reference: `PseudoEvents`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/module%3Asap%2Fui%2Fevents%2FPseudoEvents.events)\n\n",
