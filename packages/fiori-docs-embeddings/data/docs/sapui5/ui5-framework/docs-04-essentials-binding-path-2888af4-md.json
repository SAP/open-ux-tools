In all models provided by the framework, the separator char is the slash \"/\".\n\nA binding path can either be absolute or relative: Absolute binding paths start with a slash, relative binding paths start with a name token and are resolved relative to the context of the control that is bound. A context exists either for each entry of the aggregation in case of aggregation binding or can be set explicitly for a control by using the `setBindingContext` method.\n\nWhen you use multiple models, specify the model name within the binding path to address the correct model. The same applies for setting a binding context for such a model. The binding path must start with the model name followed by a '\\>' as shown in the following example for setting a binding context.\n\n```js\noControl.setBindingContext(oContext );\noControl.setBindingContext(oContext,\"myModelName\");\n```\n\nBinding path examples:\n\n```\n'/Products/0/ProductName'\n'/Products(0)/ProductName'\n'ProductName'\n\n//with model name\n'myModelName>/Products/0/ProductName'\n'myModelName>/Products(0)/ProductName'\n'myModelName>ProductName'\n```\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[OData V2 Model](odata-v2-model-6c47b2b.md#loio6c47b2b39db9404582994070ec3d57a2 \"The OData V2 Model enables binding of controls to data from OData services.\")\n\n[OData V4 Model: Bindings](bindings-54e0ddf.md \"Bindings connect SAPUI5 view elements to model data, allowing changes in the model to be reflected in the view element and vice versa.\")\n\n[Binding Path Syntax for JSON Models](json-model-96804e3.md#loiod52e364907f94a3caeb4f5e5ad0cf302 \"The JSON model has a simple binding path syntax, because it consists of named objects, such as properties, arrays, or nested objects.\")\n\n[Binding Path Syntax for XML Models](xml-model-a53e71d.md#loiob8a2c24356c443228f7819d45697a2b8 \"XML models differentiate between attributes and content.
