A log entry contains a timestamp, a log level, a message with optional details, and component information.\n\nLog messages can be written by the framework or the application code. Which log messages are contained in the log is defined according to their severity and the log level that is currently set.\n\nSpecific log messages only appear in the console when the severity of the issue is equal to or higher than the currently set log level. For example, when opening an SAPUI5 app without any additional configuration, the default log level \\(1 = `ERROR`\\) is applied. Only messages with severity `FATAL` and `ERROR` will be written to the console; other messages are not logged for performance reasons.\n\n> ### Tip:  \n> In productive applications, you should keep the system defaults for log levels for performance reasons.\n\n**Severities and Log Levels**\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nSeverity\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nLog Level\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nDescription\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nExample\n\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`NONE` \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n\\-1\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nNo messages are written to the console\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`FATAL` \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n0\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nUnrecoverable situations\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nA parse error occurred while processing a JavaScript file or an XML view\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`ERROR` \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1 \\(Default\\)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nErroneous but recoverable situations\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nLoading a requested module failed\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`WARNING` \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nUnwanted but foreseen situations\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nWrong property format was passed to a control\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`INFO` \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n3\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nPurely informative\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nA configuration parameter was set\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`DEBUG` \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n4 \\(Debug Mode\\)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInformation necessary for debugging\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nA framework event was fired\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`TRACE` \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n5\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nTracing the program flow\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nA certain position in the code was reached\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`ALL` \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n6\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nMessages of all severity categories are written to the console\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio9f4d62c6648a423d85aaf2bfc2c7ddfe__section_wmr_fnd_xz\"/>\n\n## Tracing Errors\n\nDuring development, or when you're troubleshooting application errors, you can increase the log level for debugging . When you enable debug mode, for example in the *Technical Information* dialog, the log level is automatically increased to 4 \\(`DEBUG`\\) and you will see messages in the console that might be helpful for finding bugs.\n\nYou can also set the log level manually, either by calling `Log.setLevel(<level>)` in the application code \\(see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/module:sap/base/Log%23methods/sap/base/Log.setLevel)\\) or by setting the `sap-ui-log-level=<level>` framework parameter \\(see [Configuration Options and URL Parameters](configuration-options-and-url-parameters-91f2d03.md)\\). Depending on the log level, you might get a large amount of log messages in the console. The error might not be clearly visible from a single log message and might need further analysis.\n\nLog entries are written to the console in chronological order. When you identify a message in the console that is connected to the error you are tracing, there might be other related log messages written shortly before or after the current message.\n\nA dash separates the log message and the component \\(or feature\\) that logged it.\n\nTo find out which messages are related to a specific error, you can filter the messages in the console. Narrow down the log messages by selecting a severity or doing a full-text search, for example for a specific keyword or an SAPUI5 component.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio9f4d62c6648a423d85aaf2bfc2c7ddfe__section_g5r_gnd_xz\"/>\n\n## Adding Your Own Log Messages\n\nYou can define your own log messages in your code to help tracing errors and understanding the application flow. You can use the `Log` API to create and manage log entries \\(see the [API Reference: `sap/base/log`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/module%3Asap%2Fbase%2FLog)\\).\n\n\n\n### Generic Log Entries\n\nTo log a message, simply call `Log.*` with the specific method that corresponds to the log levels described above. The following code line issues a log statement with severity *Error*. The browser highlights the statement in red to indicate an application error:\n\n```\n// \"Log\" required from module \"sap/base/Log\"\nLog.error(\"This should never have happened!\");\n```\n\nThe next code line issues a log statement with severity *Information*. The browser does not display this statement if your log console is set to filter for errors only:\n\n```\n// \"Log\" required from module \"sap/base/Log\"\nLog.info(\"Something has happened\");\n```\n\n\n\n### Component Logging\n\nThe log statements above do not contain the component. A log component can be used to semantically group log entries that belong to the same software component \\(or feature\\).\n\nIt can be specified as an additional argument to the log function or as a default for all log entries written by a certain component. With `Log.getLogger(\"<component>\")`, you can retrieve a logger that automatically adds the given component as component parameter to each log entry.\n\n```\n// \"Log\" required from module \"sap/base/Log\"\nthis._oLogger = Log.getLogger(\"sap.ui.demo.MyComponent\");\nthis._oLogger.info(\"Something has happened\");\n```\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The log entries can also be accessed programmatically. You can also register a listener to the log that will be notified whenever a new entry is added to the log.\n\n\n\n### Assertions\n\nFor logical checks in your application flow, you can use assertions. With `sap/base/assert` an error message is logged when a given condition is not met.\n\n```\n// \"assert\" required from module \"sap/base/assert\"\nassert(aValues.length === 10, \"There are 10 values stored in the array\")\n```\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Assertions might be removed when the JavaScript code is optimized during a build. Therefore, callers should not rely on any side effects of this method.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Debugging](debugging-c9b0f8c.md#loioc9b0f8cca852443f9b8d3bf8ba5626ab \"When developing apps, searching for bugs is an inevitable part of the process.
