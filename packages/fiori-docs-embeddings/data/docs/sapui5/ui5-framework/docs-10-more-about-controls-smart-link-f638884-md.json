They can also restore the links they selected to the previous state.\n\n\n\n## Details\n\nWithin a `SmartTable` or `SmartForm` control, the `SmartLink` control is created automatically if the `SemanticObject` annotation has been defined in the metadata of the OData service used. Navigation targets are determined by the `SmartLink` control and its classes using the `CrossApplicationNavigation` service of the unified shell. For more information about this service, see [CrossApplicationNavigation](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ushell.services.CrossApplicationNavigation.html) in the Demo Kit.\n\nThe events of the `SmartLink` control allow the consuming application to do the following in the popover:\n\n-   Add, edit, or remove\n\n    -   Texts\n\n    -   Parameters\n\n    -   Navigation targets\n\n\n-   Add an additional customized area\n\nThe `SmartLink` control can be created in an XML view or in the coding. However, it is recommended to use the `SemanticObject` definition of the OData metadata via the related annotation. This ensures that the `SmartLink` control is instantiated in a correct manner.\n\n\n\n### Semantic Object Controller\n\nWithin a `SmartTable` or `SmartForm` control, the `SemanticObjectController` class is used as a central instance that is exposing the automatically generated events of the `SmartLink` control.\n\nAll events of the `SmartLink` control and the features of the navigation popover connected to it are registered with the `SemanticObjectController` class and are thus available for use by the consuming application from one single source.\n\nIn addition, the `SemanticObjectController` class enables further features that influence the behavior of the registered `SmartLink` controls within the `SmartTable` or `SmartForm` controls.\n\nThe `SemanticObjectController` class can be set up in the XML view as well as in the coding of the `SmartTable` and the `SmartForm` controls. All `SmartLink` controls in a `SmartTable` or `SmartForm` control will automatically get registered with the `SemanticObjectController` class provided.\n\n",
