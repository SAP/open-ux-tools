Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \\(such as tree binding\\). This also applies to smart controls \\(`sap.ui.comp` library\\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).\n\nFor more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.67</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-06-20\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.67 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.ShellBar`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.ShellBar`**\n\n-   You can now define a custom tooltip for the home icon of the control using the new `homeIconTooltip` property.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.ShellBar).\n\n-   A new search functionality is now available for the control. You can enable it by using the new `searchManager` aggregation which accepts controls of type `sap.f.SearchManager`.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.ShellBar) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.ShellBar/sample/sap.f.sample.ShellBarWithSearch).\n\n-   Two different types of menu and title are now enabled for the control:\n\n    -   If you need a separate menu button and a plain title, set the `showMenuButton` property to `true`.\n\n    -   To display the title as part of a configurable mega menu, set the `showMenuButton` property to `false` and use the `menu` aggregation.\n\n\n    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.ShellBar) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.ShellBar).\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.67</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-06-20\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.67 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.OverflowToolbar`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.OverflowToolbar`**\n\nTo improve the control's performance, we have introduced a new `asyncMode` property.
