For more information, see [Enabling Editing Using a Dialog \\(Mass Edit\\) in the List Report](enabling-editing-using-a-dialog-mass-edit-in-the-list-report-7cc4f04.md).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio965ef5b2895641bc9b6cd44f1bd0eb4d__section_mjc_ccs_hnb\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4\n\nYou can use the mass edit dialog on the object page in edit mode and in the list report. Use the `enableMassEdit` property in the `manifest.json` file to enable the feature. You can use the following settings for the `enableMassEdit` property:\n\n-   Undefined \\(mass edit is disabled\\)\n\n-   A Boolean property\n\n-   An object which can contain two properties:\n\n    -   `visibleFields`\n\n    -   `ignoredFields`\n\n\n\nThe `visibleFields` property lets you specify which fields are available in the mass edit dialog, even if these fields are not displayed in the table. The `ignoredFields` property lets you hide specific fields from the mass edit dialog, even if these fields are displayed in the table. When the end user chooses the *Edit* button, the editability of each field is evaluated. Read-only fields are automatically excluded from the mass edit dialog, and changes are only applied to fields that are editable.\n\nTo enhance performance when loading the mass edit dialog, use the `visibleFields` property.\n\nYou can only use one of these properties at a time. If the `visibleFields` property is set, then the `ignoredFields` property is ignored.\n\nBoth properties can contain a `FieldGroup` annotation or a comma-separated list of properties. A combination of both isn't supported.\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> The Setting in the `manifest.json` File to Toggle the Mass Edit Functionality\n> \n> ```\n> \"controlConfiguration\": {\n>    \"_Item/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem\": {\n>       \"tableSettings\": {\n>          ......\n>          ......\n>          \"enableMassEdit\": true\n>       },\n>       ......\n>       ......\n> }\n> ```\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> The Setting in the `manifest.json` File to Toggle the Mass Edit Functionality Using the `visibleFields` Property\n> \n> ```\n> \"controlConfiguration\": {\n>    \"_Item/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem\": {\n>       \"tableSettings\": {\n>          ......\n>          ......\n>          \"enableMassEdit\": {\n>              \n>       },\n>       ......\n>       ......\n> }\n> ```\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> The Setting in the `manifest.json` File to Toggle the Mass Edit Functionality Using the `ignoredFields` Property\n> \n> ```\n> \"controlConfiguration\": {\n>    _Item/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem: {\n>       \"tableSettings\": {\n>          ......\n>          ......\n>          \"enableMassEdit\": {\n>              \"ignoredFields\": \"property2,property3\"\n>       },\n>       ......\n>       ......\n> }\n> ```\n\n\n\n### Operation Grouping for Mass Edit\n\nYou can define how the changes using mass edit should be applied:\n\n-   `ChangeSet`: Grouped for all objects within the same request.\n\n-   `Isolated`: Separately for each object \\(as an individual OData change set in the same request\\).\n\n\nYou can set the mode for mass editing by using the `operationGroupingMode` key in the `manifest.json`.\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> `manifest.json`\n> \n> ```\n> \"controlConfiguration\": {\n>    _Item/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem: {\n>       \"tableSettings\": {\n>          ......\n>          ......\n>          \"enableMassEdit\": {\n>             ......\n>             \"operationGroupingMode\": \"Isolated\"\n>       },\n>       ......\n>       ......\n> }\n> ```\n\nThe default mode for mass editing is `ChangeSet` on the object page and `Isolated` in the list report.\n\n\n\n### Enabling the Mass Edit Functionality\n\nThe following prerequisites apply:\n\n-   Application developers must have enabled the functionality in the `manifest.json` file, as shown in the preceding sample codes.\n\n-   End users must select at least one record.\n\n-   On the object page, mass edit is only available in edit mode.\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> You can enable the mass edit feature for back-end services based on CAP `Node.js` by setting a feature flag. For more information, see [https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/releases/dec23\\#sapui5-mass-edit](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/releases/dec23#sapui5-mass-edit).\n\nWhen an end user clicks the *Edit* button, a dialog opens showing all the editable fields that are visible in the table or configured using the `visibleFields` property or the `ignoreFields` property. The end user can clear all values or set a value for every editable field of the selected records in one go or clear all values of the fields from the selected records.\n\nThe *Edit* button isn't visible if the table entity has an update restriction set to static `false`. Visibility can also be controlled by using a value for `UI.UpdateHidden` \\(you can use a path-based value, but it can only point to the parent path for a table on an object page or subobject page, and to a singleton in a list report table\\).\n\nThe *Edit* button isn't enabled if the update restriction points to a path and the path evaluates to `false`.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> -   Mass editing doesn't change the draft or active status of the object.\n> \n> -   If the parent entity has a navigation restriction to the table entity set, this takes priority over the update restriction of the table entity set.\n> \n> -   If the mass edit functionality is enabled and if `selectionMode` isn't specified or set to `\"Multi\"`, then users can select multiple records â€“ irrespective of other conditions \\(for example, multiple selection is possible even if there are no table toolbar actions that require context\\).\n> \n> -   The suggestion list in the fields \\(showing the values for this field from the selected records in the table\\) within the mass edit dialog doesn't appear if the following applies:\n> \n>     -   The field is part of `Common.ValueListParameterIn` mapping of another field, and this other field is filled with a value.\n> \n>         Example:\n> \n>         `\"Country\"` has an `In` mapping to `\"City\"`. If an end user selects a value for the field `\"Country\"` within the mass edit dialog, no suggestion list is available for the field `\"City\"`.\n> \n>     -   The field has a `Common.ValueListParameterOut` mapping to another field.\n> \n>         Example:\n> \n>         If `EmployeeID` is picked from the suggestion list and if there are two reporting lines \\(two different `Managers`\\) for this `EmployeeID`, the `Out` mapping \\(the `Manager` field\\) cannot be populated with the correct value.\n> \n> \n> -   If the mass edit functionality is enabled for an object page and the service is ETag enabled, you must ensure that the ETag implementation is in `etag master`. This means the ETag value of the child entity doesn't depend on the ETag value of the parent \\(that is, the root entity\\).\n> \n> -   In the mass edit dialog, the already selected values are proposed only for the first 30 selected lines.\n> \n> -   When selecting more than 30 lines, the mass edit dialog is displayed directly. The editability of each field for each line is computed in the background and used when performing the save.\n\n> ### Restriction:  \n> -   The following fields are not available in the mass edit dialog:\n> \n>     -   Image-based fields\n> \n>     -   `DataFieldForAnnotation`-based fields, such as the following:\n> \n>         -   Micro-chart-based fields\n> \n>         -   Contact fields\n> \n>         -   Fields coming from a `FieldGroup`-based field in the table\n> \n> \n>     -   Multi-input fields\n> \n>     -   Fields coming from navigation entities\n> \n>     -   Custom fields\n> \n>     -   Fields that have context-dependent value help\n> \n>         For more information, see [Field Help](field-help-a5608ea.md).\n> \n>     -   Value help fields with a dropdown list that has fixed values \\(`@Common.ValueListWithFixedValues: true`\\)\n> \n> \n> -   Validation from the server for updates made in the mass edit dialog isn't supported. There's no communication with the back end until users choose *Save* in the mass edit dialog.\n> \n> -   You must not enable the mass edit functionality if the back end is configured to lock the entire object while you're making an update to a child object.\n\n",
