Additionally they are used to parse and validate the values in UI controls before they are saved back to the model. The new interval types are:\n\n-   `sap.ui.model.type.DateInterval` - a date interval \\(without time\\)\n\n-   `sap.ui.model.type.DateTimeInterval` - a date interval with the exact point of time\n\n-   `sap.ui.model.type.TimeInterval` - a time interval \\(without date\\)\n\n\nFor more information, see [sap.ui.model.type.DateTimeInterval](../04_Essentials/sap-ui-model-type-datetimeinterval-94658aa.md) and the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.type). \n\n<sub>New•Feature•Info Only•1.50</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2017-11-09\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.50\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nNew \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`animationMode`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`animationMode`**\n\nThe configuration option `animationMode` replaces `animation`, which is now deprecated. The new option supports several states \\(`full`, `basic`, `minimal`, `none`\\), which allow controls to extend support for animations in a more granular way instead of a binary `on`/`off` state. For more information, see [Configuration Options and URL Parameters](../04_Essentials/configuration-options-and-url-parameters-91f2d03.md), [Implementing Animation Modes](../09_Developing_Controls/implementing-animation-modes-76b7d50.md), and the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration.AnimationMode). \n\n<sub>New•Feature•Info Only•1.50</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2017-11-09\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.50\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nNew \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.export`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.export`**\n\nThis new library provides APIs for exporting a client-side spreadsheet using an XLSX file format.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.export).\n\n<sub>New•Feature•Info Only•1.50</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2017-11-09\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.50\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nNew \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.PlanningCalendarLegend`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.PlanningCalendarLegend`**\n\n`sap.m.PlanningCalendarLegend` enables two types of items to be displayed in the `sap.m.PlanningCalendar` as a legend - types of days \\(for example, special dates and holidays\\) and appointments.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.PlanningCalendarLegend).\n\n![](images/WhatsNew_150_PlanningCalendarLegend_e8f3d35.png)\n\n<sub>New•Control•Info Only•1.50</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2017-11-09\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.50\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nNew \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.suite.ui.commons.networkgraph`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.suite.ui.commons.networkgraph`**\n\nYou can use this control to visualize data as a graph that illustrates how individual records are related. Displaying data as a network graph may also help you to highlight some of the data discrepancies that might be overlooked when the same data is displayed as a list or any other form of text.\n\nThe network graph supports both directed and undirected graphs and even graphs that contain cycles. The control provides broad customization options, enabling you to separate the graph layout from its rendering and to position individual graph elements freely, for example, when displaying geospatial data on top of a map.\n\nFor more information, see [Network Graph](../10_More_About_Controls/network-graph-b5649c8.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.commons.networkgraph) and the [samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.networkgraph.Graph).\n\n![](images/Whats_New_150_NetworkGraph1_05f571a.png)\n\n<sub>New•Control•Info Only•1.50</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2017-11-09\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.50\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nNew \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.suite.ui.commons.statusindicator`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.suite.ui.commons.statusindicator`**\n\nYou can use the `StatusIndicator` control to display a percentage value in the form of a fillable shape, translating plain numbers into meaningful shapes that visually convey the status of the items they represent.\n\nYou can fully customize the control by setting fill direction and fill color and by picking a shape that matches the value measured. In addition to the library of standard shapes, you can define your own custom SVG shapes. This allows you to create a powerful connection between your data and business by using symbols from a particular domain—for example, a half-filled truck shape may represent a real delivery truck filled up to 50% of its capacity.\n\nThe status indicator is best used in tiles, tables, and object pages.\n\nFor more information, see [Status Indicator](../10_More_About_Controls/status-indicator-8d5664a.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.commons.statusindicator.StatusIndicator) and the [sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.StatusIndicator).\n\n![](images/Whats_New_150_Status_Indicator_9ce1ff0.png)\n\n<sub>New•Control•Info Only•1.50</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2017-11-09\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.50\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**\n\nThe new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces an adapter that allows you to use an OData V2 service together with the OData V4 model in read scenarios. The adapter offers the following features:\n\n-   Metadata is converted, including some V2 annotations.\n\n-   Data in the response is converted.\n\n-   Literals in the request URI are converted, except for `Edm.DateTime`, `Edm.DateTimeOffset`, `Edm.Time`, and `Edm.Binary`.\n\n-   `$select`, `$expand`, and `$orderby` are handled. Cases that are not supported by OData V2, like `$orderby` in `$expand`, lead to an error.\n\n-   All unsupported query options lead to an error.\n\n\n> ### Caution:  \n> **Incompatibility Due to a Bug Fix**\n> \n> The following bug has been reported: If you call the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\\#getObject\\(\\)](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/getObject) or the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\\#requestObject\\(\\)](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/requestObject) methods without a parameter, the expected and documented behavior is that the same result is returned as if the parameter `sPath=\"\"` had been specified. However, due to the bug, the return value wraps the expected output that can then only be accessed via `.value[0]`, for example `oContext.getObject().value[0]`.\n> \n> **If you have used this workaround, your application will break starting with SAPUI5 version 1.44.7.**\n> \n> **Solution**: If your application needs to run with both the fixed and unfixed versions of SAPUI5, specify the `sPath=\"\"` parameter, for the `sPath` parameter. In both cases, you **must not** use the workaround with `.value[0]` any longer.\n\n> ### Restriction:  \n> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \\(such as tree binding\\). This also applies to Smart Controls \\(`sap.ui.comp` library\\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).\n\nFor more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.50</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2017-11-09\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.50\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Support Assistant: OPA Test Sample Added** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Support Assistant: OPA Test Sample Added**\n\nWith the roll-out of Support Assistant in version 1.48, we introduced the possibility to use the tool in OPA tests to check if there are issues in the different states of an application. This is possible by enabling the available OPA extension.\n\nAs of this version, there is now a sample of the OPA integration in the Demo Kit. It demonstrates how you can extend existing OPA tests by making calls to the assertions in the Support Assistant extension. These assertions may have different severity, execution scope and subset of rules which are taken into consideration. The sample also shows how to execute rule checks and how to get reports.\n\nAs of this version, there is now a sample of the OPA integration in the Demo Kit. For more information, see [Integrating the Rules in OPA Tests](../04_Essentials/integrating-the-rules-in-opa-tests-cfabbd4.md) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.OpaWithSupportAssistant/preview).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.50</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2017-11-09\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.50\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.DynamicPage`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.DynamicPage`**\n\n**`sap.f.DynamicPage`** has the following new features:\n\n-   You can now define the priority of the `DynamicPageTitle` areas with the use of the new `primaryArea` property.
