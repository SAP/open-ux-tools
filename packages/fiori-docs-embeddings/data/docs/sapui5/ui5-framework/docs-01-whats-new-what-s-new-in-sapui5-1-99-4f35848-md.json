The found context is [set to keep-alive](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/setKeepAlive) and returned. For more information, see [Relative Bindings](../04_Essentials/data-reuse-648e360.md#loio648e360fa22d46248ca783dc6eb44531__section_relativeBindings).\n\n-   In a list binding, you can now create new records at the beginning of the list, but below previously created new records. For this, you have to set the `bAtEnd` parameter to `false` in the first call of [`sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#create`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding%23methods/create), and to `true` in all subsequent calls.\n\n-   We enabled the [creation](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding%23methods/create) of inactive rows, introduced with SAPUI5 1.97 for `Auto` update groups, also for `API` groups. For more information on batch groups, see [Batch Control](../04_Essentials/batch-control-74142a3.md).\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.99</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-02-22\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.99 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Carousel`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Carousel`**\n\nThe control now shows `sap.m.illustratedMessage` in use cases where there’s nothing to display.

These options are similar to the existing `From / To`, `From`, and `To`, but the new ones include time selection. When the new options are not used together with their date-only alternatives, their names are simplified, respectively to `From / To`, `From`, and `To`.\n\n-   `Month in Year`: When this option is selected, a `Calendar` control appears, and the user can pick a month and a year.\n\n\nFor more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.TimePicker) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.TimePicker/sample/sap.m.sample.TimePicker).\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.99</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-02-22\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.99 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar`**\n\nWe have introduced new behavior – an option to zoom in and zoom out to make the calendar appointments easier to read. You can do this by using the new `scaleFactor` property that changes the height of the calendar rows. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar).\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.99</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-02-22\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.99 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.upload.UploadSet`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.upload.UploadSet`**\n\nYou can now drag the `UploadSetItems` within `UploadSet` to rearrange the items.\n\nThe `itemDragStart` and `itemDrop` events are also being exposed. These events return the item as a parameter to the event handler. The events are triggered when you drag and drop items that have already been uploaded.\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.99</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-02-22\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.99 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`**\n\n`SmartField` in read-only mode now supports time zones for `Edm.DateTimeOffset` fields with the following annotation\n\n```\n<Annotation Term=\"com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Timezone\" Path=\"ClockInTimezone\"/>\n```\n\nYou can format the date in the `sap.ui.core.CustomData` class with `key:“dateFormatSettings”`. You can also add a property with 3 options for the time zone: `show`, `hide`, or apply a `pattern`.\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.99</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-02-22\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.99 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`**\n\n-   `SmartFilterBar` now allows you to set the default operation for a filter field just by setting the `conditionPanelDefaultOperation` configuration in the `ControlConfiguration` object. The `SmartFilterBar` filter fields can have different default operations as long as they are valid for the data type of the particular field. For instance, you can’t set a \"StartsWith\" operation in a numeric field because this is only relevant for string filter fields. If an invalid default operation is set, it is ignored.\n\n-   You can now configure all `Edm.DateTimeOffset` fields with `filter-restriction=\"interval\"` to render the new `DynamicDateRange` control by setting the `useDateRangeType` property of `SmartFilterBar` to `true` or by using `controlConfiguration`. We've also added two new options for these fields: *Date and Time* and *Date Time Range*.\n\n    Have in mind that extending `DateRangeType` is not supported. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfilterbar.UseDateRangeType).\n\n-   Accessing internal controls from applications often affects the expected functionality of `SmartFilterBar`. Therefore, we have deprecated the following methods that return instances of internal controls in `sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`:\n\n    -   `sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar#getControlByKey`\n\n    -   `sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar#determineControlByFilterItem`\n\n    -   `sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar#determineControlByName`\n\n    -   `sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBarFilterGroupItem#setControl`\n\n    -   `sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBarFilterGroupItem#getControl`\n\n\n\nFor more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfilterbar.CustomField).\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.99</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-02-22\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.99 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable`**\n\nWe now support the `com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Timezone` annotation.

This comes with several new features: `label` support for input elements inside cards; support for required fields via the `isRequired` property of the input elements; support for `errorMessage`; support for the `style` property for actions. For more information, see the [Adaptive Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/adaptive) Learn section and the [Styled Actions Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/adaptive/styled-actions) in the Card Explorer.\n\n-   The Calendar card supports placeholder loading - a type of busy indicator that provides the user with a rough outline of the content while it is loading.\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.99</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-02-22\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.99 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSAP Fiori Elements \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAP Fiori elements for OData V2** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAP Fiori elements for OData V2**\n\nThe following changes and new features are available for SAP Fiori elements for OData V2:\n\n-   The `DataFieldWithUrl` annotation is now supported in the header section for external navigation targets.

For more information, see [Adding Actions to Tables](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/adding-actions-to-tables-b623e0b.md).\n\n-   Single-valued date fields now use the `sap.m.DynamicDateRange` control. This enables end users to use semantic date operators like `\"TODAY\"` and `\"TOMORROW\"`, as well as date pickers. For more information, see [Enabling Semantic Operators in the Filter Bar](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/enabling-semantic-operators-in-the-filter-bar-fef65d0.md).\n\n-   You can now also use semantic dates in the `FilterBar` building block.
