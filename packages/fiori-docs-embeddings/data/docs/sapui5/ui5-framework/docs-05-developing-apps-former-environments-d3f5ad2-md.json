SAP no longer actively supports or distributes them, but in theory they can still be used.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiod3f5ad2ec52b4ed0b5a272c1ce52a6f3__section_g2f_qd2_wmb\"/>\n\n## SAP Web IDE\n\nSAP Web IDE is a web-based development environment that is optimized for developing SAPUI5 complex apps using the latest innovations, developing and extending SAP Fiori apps, developing mobile hybrid apps, and extending SAP Web IDE with plug-ins and templates.\n\n\n\n### Current Status\n\nSAP Web IDE can still be used if you have a productive SAP Business Technology Platform global account and have activated SAP Web IDE there.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> It is no longer possible to access SAP Web IDE via a SAP BTP free tier account.\n\nIt is recommended to use SAP Business Application Studio instead. See [App Development Using SAP Business Application Studio](app-development-using-sap-business-application-studio-6bbad66.md).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiod3f5ad2ec52b4ed0b5a272c1ce52a6f3__section_k5f_l32_wmb\"/>\n\n## SAPUI5 Tools for Eclipse\n\nSAPUI5 Tools for Eclipse used to provide wizards to support app creation by generating an application skeleton that contains views and controllers.\n\n\n\n### Current Status\n\nBecause there are more powerful development environments out there that offer integration with SAPUI5 app development the SAPUI5 Tools for Eclipse were retired after SAPUI5 release 1.71 and don't support Eclipse versions higher than 2019-12. for more information as well as constraints if you still want to use them, see [SAPUI5 Tools for Eclipse â€“ Now is the Time to Look for Alternatives](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/11/26/sapui5-tools-for-eclipse-now-is-the-time-to-look-for-alternatives/)\n\nSAPUI5 documentation version 1.71 is the last version of the SAPUI5 documentation that explains the SAPUI5 Tools for Eclipse: [App Development Using SAPUI5 Tools for Eclipse \\(1.71\\)](https://ui5.sap.com/1.71.0/#/topic/0404f90ff7394aa08c8420995bfdd9ed)\n\n> ### Note:  \n> You can still use Eclipse as a development environment on its own, of course. Only the SAPUI5 Tools for Eclipse \\(that is, the ABAP repository team provider and the app development tools have been retired.\n\n",
