For more information, see [Building Blocks](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/building-blocks-24c1304.md).\n\n-   We've changed the handling of the draft concept in SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, which results in the following UI changes:\n\n    -   When users edit an object page, we've changed how they switch between the draft and the saved version of a document, to make it more intuitive.\n\n        Until now, when working with the draft version of the document the user could switch to the saved version using the following button:\n\n        ![](images/Object_page_-_draft_version_of_the_object_is_shown_using_button_text_Display_Saved_Version_6337dc4.png)\n\n        Likewise, when working with the saved version of the document the user could switch to the draft using the following button:\n\n        ![](images/Object_page_-_saved_version_of_the_object_is_shown_using_button_text_Return_to_Draft_8556812.png)\n\n        As of SAPUI5 1.101, when working with the draft version of the document the user can switch to the saved version using the following popover:\n\n        ![](images/Object_page_new_concept_-_draft_version_of_the_object_is_shown_using_button_text_Draft_0971995.png)\n\n        Likewise, when working with the saved version of the document the user can switch to the draft version:\n\n        ![](images/Object_page_new_concept_-_saved_version_of_the_object_is_displayed_746ff83.png)\n\n        The highlighting and labels clearly indicate which version the user is currently working on.\n\n    -   We've changed the dialog for handling draft changes, for example in case of navigation, to better explain the available options.\n\n        Until now we showed the following confirmation dialog:\n\n        ![](images/Object_page_new_concept_-_Draft_toggling_Warning_confirmation_dialog_in_old_version_457b83f.png)\n\n        As of SAPUI5 1.101 we're showing the following confirmation dialog with the new default action *Save*:\n\n        ![](images/Object_page_new_concept_-_Draft_toggling_Warning_confirmation_dialog_in_new_version_70024f1.png)\n\n\n    For more information, see [Toggling Between Draft and Saved Values](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/toggling-between-draft-and-saved-values-fd3950a.md).\n\n-   We've replaced some keys that can be overridden by application developers using the custom i18n file approach.

For more information, see [Configuring Charts](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/configuring-charts-653ed0f.md).\n\n-   SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 applications can now use extension APIs to execute custom code before the standard functionality of SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 is triggered. For more information, see [Using Custom Code Before Standard Operations](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/using-custom-code-before-standard-operations-877e5ff.md).\n\n-   The filter bar of the value help is now expanded under certain conditions. For more information, see the *Filter Fields Within the Value Help Dialog* section in [Field Help](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/field-help-a5608ea.md).\n\n-   You can now specify a timezone for a `DateTimeOffset` field.
