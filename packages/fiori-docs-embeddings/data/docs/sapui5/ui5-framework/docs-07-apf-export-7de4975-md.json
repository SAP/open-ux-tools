An export results in the following files:\n\n-   By exporting a configuration, you create a configuration file in JSON format. This format is required, for example, to be able to transport a configuration between different systems.\n\n-   By exporting a text pool, you create a text file in .properties format. This format is necessary to be able to translate the texts. Exporting is also useful to create a backup copy of your configurations and texts.\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> In SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, you must use the apps *Export Software Collection* and *Import Collection* to transport a configuration between different systems.\n\nTo use the export function, proceed as follows:\n\n1.
