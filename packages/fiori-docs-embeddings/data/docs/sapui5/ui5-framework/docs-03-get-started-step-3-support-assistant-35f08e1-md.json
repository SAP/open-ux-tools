You can use this tool to check whether your app is built according to the best practices with predefined rules.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio35f08e10a5d74e058ce9929244d935f0__section_u2k_c1d_5z\"/>\n\n## Preview\n\n![](images/TroubelshootingTutorial_Support_Assistant_f3f8bdb.png)\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio35f08e10a5d74e058ce9929244d935f0__section_hkm_s4f_vz\"/>\n\n## Opening the Example App and Support Assistant\n\n1.  Download the example app with errors from the Demo Kitat [Troubleshooting](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.core.tutorial.troubleshooting/sample/sap.ui.core.tutorial.troubleshooting.01) and run the app.\n\n2.  Activate the Support Assistant using one of the following options:\n\n    -   Open the *Technical Information Dialog* by pressing [Ctrl\\] + [Shift\\] + [Alt\\] + [P\\]  and choose *Activate Support Assistant*.\n\n    -   Use the URL parameter: `sap-ui-support=true`.\n\n\n    The Support Assistant toolbar opens in the footer of the app.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio35f08e10a5d74e058ce9929244d935f0__section_b2v_bzk_zz\"/>\n\n## Analyzing and Fixing Issues\n\n1.  In the *Support Assistant* toolbar, choose *Rules*.\n\n2.  In the *Available Rules* tab, select all rules, and choose *Analyze*.\n\n    You now see a list of issues.\n\n3.  Select *Model: Unresolved binding path* in the list of issues. In the issue details, you see the following message: *Element HeapOfShards---app--LabelWithMissingI18NText with binding path 'Label\\_Missing\\_I18N\\_Text' has the same value as the path. Potential Error.*\n\n4.  Open the `i18n.properties` file in your development environment and add the missing text.\n\n    ```\n    [â€¦]\n    item1Text=Item 1\n    item2Text=Item 2\n    selectEventMessage=Event \"{0}\" fired.\n    Label_Missing_I18N_Text=Label Text\n    \n    ```\n\n    For more information, see [Walkthrough Step 8: Translatable Texts](step-8-translatable-texts-df86bfb.md)\n\n5.  Restart the app and start the analysis again. This issue should now be gone. We have intentionally hidden some more errors in the code - check and see if you can find and correct them.\n\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Support Assistant](../04_Essentials/support-assistant-57ccd7d.md \"The Support Assistant enables developers to check whether their apps are built according to the SAPUI5 best practices and guidelines.\")\n\n",
