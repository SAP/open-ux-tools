This enables an application to only request particular resource bundles with language-specific texts. As requests, that were previously needed to check for the availability of language files, can now be avoided, this helps to improve the runtime performance of applications.\n\nIn addition, a new configuration allows you to explicitly set the fallback locale. English used to be the default locale, but now any fallback locale can be specified.\n\n<sub>New•Feature•Info Only•1.77</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2020-04-23\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.77 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nNew \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Terminologies** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Terminologies**\n\nBy defining terminologies together with additional resource bundles, you can adapt an application for different scenarios or industries. [Terminologies](../04_Essentials/terminologies-eba8d25.md) can be configured in the `manifest.json` file and can be activated in several ways, such as via API, URL parameter, or the bootstrap configuration.\n\n<sub>New•Feature•Info Only•1.77</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2020-04-23\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.77 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**\n\nThe new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:\n\n-   You can now expand the first node of visually grouped aggregated data using `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#expand`, as described in [Data Aggregation and Recursive Hierarchy](../04_Essentials/data-aggregation-and-recursive-hierarchy-7d91431.md).\n\n    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding%23methods/setAggregation).\n\n-   Binding parameters and format options can now be passed to `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper#format`, and binding parameters can be passed to `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper#value`.\n\n    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper%23methods/).\n\n\n> ### Restriction:  \n> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Double-check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \\(such as tree binding\\). This also applies to smart controls \\(`sap.ui.comp` library\\) that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported in combination with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).\n\nFor more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.77</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2020-04-23\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.77 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Team Calendar** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Team Calendar**\n\nThis demo app is now enhanced with improvements in the navigation and available resolutions to provide better user experience.

This is useful for user-friendly visualization when working with design-time configuration tools.\n-   The markdown feature of Microsoft Adaptive Cards in `sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card` of type Adaptive is now enabled. The `TextBlock` element of the card supports a subset of Markdown syntax, that is defined in Microsoft's Adaptive Card.

To hide the title of a subsection that is the only one \\(or the only one visible\\), you need to set the `showTitle` properties to `false` for both `ObjectPageSection` and its `ObjectPageSubSection`.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.uxap.ObjectPageSubSection).\n\n-   We’ve introduced the `subSectionVisibilityChange` event.

For more information, see [Maintaining Standard Texts for Charts](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/maintaining-standard-texts-for-charts-37cd601.md).\n\n-   We have improved performance for delete actions, as both Delete and Get calls are grouped into a single batch call.\n\n-   The SAP WebIDE application creation wizard for list reports and object pages now provides an option to choose the required variant management. *Page Variant* is set as the default with an option to change to *No Variant* and *Control Level Variant*.\n\n-   Autoload is triggered for list report and object page apps that have at least one filter set or have custom variants as default. Autoload is not triggered if applications have Standard Variant as default with no filters.\n\n-   We now provide a fallback navigation when navigating to the object page of an object that was deleted. The navigation will fallback to the list page of source application if the object is not found during back navigation from target application.\n\n-   We now provide an option to reuse custom column
