For more information, see [Side Effects](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/side-effects-18b17bd.md).\n\n-   The analytical list page now supports the dynamic date range in `SmartFilterBar`.

The new method returns a single SAPUI5 element instead of the array of SAPUI5 elements returned by `jQuery.fn.control`. You might therefore need to add an outer loop when migrating your code to the new API.\n\nFor more information, see [Replacement of Deprecated jQuery APIs](../04_Essentials/replacement-of-deprecated-jquery-apis-a075ed8.md)and the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Element/methods/sap.ui.core.Element.closestTo).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.108</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-11-03\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.108 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**\n\nThe new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:\n\n-   We now provide \"deferred delete\" requests: You can call the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#delete` method with an API group; the back-end request is then only sent when `ODataModel#submitBatch` is called for this API group. For more information, see [Deleting an Entity](../04_Essentials/deleting-an-entity-2613ebc.md).\n-   We have improved our documentation of how to overwrite value list annotations in local annotation files. For more information, see [Value Lists](../04_Essentials/value-lists-ab267a6.md).\n-   The `dataRequested` and `dataReceived` events introduced with SAPUI5 1.106 for the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel` now provide the path for additional property requests.For more information, see the API Reference for [`ODataModel.dataReceived`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/events/dataReceived) and [`ODataModel.dataRequested`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/events/dataRequested).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.108</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-11-03\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.108 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V2 Model** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V2 Model**\n\nThe new version of the SAPUI5 OData V2 model introduces the following features:\n\n-   We now support \"deep create\" requests for navigation properties of cardinality \"many\".

For more information, see the [Adaptive Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesOther/adaptive) Learn section in the Card Explorer.\n\n-   You can now configure the visibility of the card footer using the new `visible` boolean property. Card developers can set this property in the manifest. Additionally, they can add it to the `Configuration.js`, which will also enable card administrators, who are using the Configuration editor, to control the visibility of the card footer. For more information, see the [Card Footer](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/footer) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/footer/hiddenFooter) in the Card Explorer.\n\n-   We have made the loading placeholder for Analytical cards more detailed to better reveal the expected loading content. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card/sample/sap.ui.integration.sample.LazyLoading).\n\n-   We have \\(experimentally\\) enhanced the `sap.ui.integration.Extension` with a new `loadDependencies` lifecycle hook. As a card developer, you can use it to load critical dependencies for your extension, without which the data cannot be displayed. While the dependencies are loaded, the card displays a loading animation. This hook is asynchronous, so other tasks won't be blocked. For more information, see the [Card Extension](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/extension) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/extension/loadDependencies) in the Card Explorer, and the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.integration.Extension).\n\n-   A new `visible` property is now introduced for icons and avatars to achieve consistency in representation if an empty value for the `src` property is used in the card manifest. The new property is available for:\n\n    -   Default Header\n    -   Sap.f.CardHeader\n    -   ObjectContent\n    -   TableContent\n    -   List Content\n\n    For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/iconVisibility) in the Card Explorer. \n\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.108</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-11-03\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.108 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nUI Changed \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nAnnouncement \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Analytical List Pages: Date Ranges Supported** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Analytical List Pages: Date Ranges Supported**\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The following information concerns important upcoming changes for end users.
