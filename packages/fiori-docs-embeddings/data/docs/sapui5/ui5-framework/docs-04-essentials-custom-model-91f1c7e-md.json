Extend the `Model` class and specify the binding modes that the model should support \\(for example, two-way, one-way, one-time\\).\n\n2.  Extend the `Binding` class to suit your specific binding or reuse the existing specific binding implementations `PropertyBinding`, `ListBinding`, and/or `TreeBinding`.\n\n3.  To enable the filtering functionality, use the `Filter` class with `FilterOperator` enum in your binding implementation.\n\n4.  To enable the sorting functionality, use the `Sorter` class in your binding implementation.\n\n\nYou can find all necessary classes in the `sap.ui.model` namespace. As a starting point, take a look at the `JSONModel` implementation in `sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel`, which is available on the SAP Open Source GitHub at [https://github.com/SAP/openui5/blob/-/src/sap.ui.core/src/sap/ui/model/json/JSONModel.js](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/blob/-/src/sap.ui.core/src/sap/ui/model/json/JSONModel.js).\n\n",
