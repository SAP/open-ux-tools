Define the descriptor configuration file with a qualifier and map it to the UI.KPI annotation. If this annotation is not configured, then the `UI.SelectionPresentationVariant` annotation with the same qualifier name takes effect.\n\nWe recommended using a single SAP-wide KPI gallery based on the KPIs generated by standard SAP KPI creation tools, such as the SAP Smart Business framework.\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> Descriptor setting\n> \n> ```\n> \"KPIQuantity\": {\n>                 \"model\": \"kpi\",\n>                 \"entitySet\": \"SEPMRA_C_ALP_SlsOrdItemCubeALPResults\",\n>                 \"qualifier\": \"KPIQuantity\n> }\n> \n> ```\n\nTo enable navigation for a KPI card, you need to define the semantic object, action, and KPI ID in the `UI.KPI` annotation. The KPI ID is passed to the target application as the `EvaluationId` for launching the smart business application.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Analytical List Page](analytical-list-page-3d33684.md \"The analytical list page (ALP) offers a unique way to analyze data step by step from different perspectives, to investigate a root cause through drilldown, and to act on transactional content.\")\n\n[Managing Variants](managing-variants-8ce658e.md \"Allows you manage variants with different structures in the filter and content areas.\")\n\n[Creating Key Performance Indicator Tags](creating-key-performance-indicator-tags-d80a360.md \"The key performance indicator (KPI) tag is an abbreviated and clickable title with a KPI value.\")\n\n[Choosing Filter Modes](choosing-filter-modes-00c19e1.md \"ALP offers compact and visual filter modes.
