It complements the `sap.m.FeedListItem` control to create a simple feed. You can use the `FeedInput` control if you need to input small amounts of text without formatting.\n\n![Feed Input Example](images/Suite_Feed_Input_aca3b10.png)\n\nFor more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.FeedInput) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.FeedInput).\n\n**Responsiveness**\n\nThe feed input control can be used in small and large containers due to its responsive behavior.\n\n**Layout**\n\nThe feeder \\(that is, feed input\\) is used to write plain text and \\(depending on the context\\) to then create a note or feed entry by choosing the *Send* pushbutton. The `FeedInput` control provides the possibility to display a picture of the current user.\n\nIf the user image has not yet been set, a generic placeholder is shown. If the app does not support user images at all, the image can be omitted.\n\nFor more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.FeedInput).\n\n**Behavior**\n\nInitially, the feeder contains an input prompt, and the *Send* pushbutton is disabled. You can click into the input field to focus on it.\n\nWhen the user starts to type, the input prompt disappears and the *Send* pushbutton is enabled and becomes more prominent.\n\nIf the available width is less than 25 rem \\(for example, portrait mode on a mobile phone\\), the picture is removed.\n\nThe `sap.m.FeedInput` control can be used in combination with the `sap.m.FeedListItem` control as a feed or notes control. For more information, see the [Feed List Item](feed-list-item-14a9900.md) control documentation.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If you need only one single text box instance, use the `sap.m.TextArea` control for multi-line text. For more information, see the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.TextArea).\n> \n> Or you use the `sap.m.Text` control for single-line text. For more information, see the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.Text).\n\n",
