If the user adds more columns in the *View Settings* dialog in a table where several columns are already in the pop-in area, and these new columns are also moved to the pop-in area because of their importance, these columns are not hidden but are now made visible automatically. This makes it easier for users to recognize which columns have been added. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable%23methods/getDetailsButtonSetting) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smarttable.mtableShowDetails).\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.107</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-10-06\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.107 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.List, sap.m.Table, sap.m.Tree`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.List, sap.m.Table, sap.m.Tree`**\n\nTo improve performance, we have now made the initial rendering faster: Table, tree, and list items are now already created when the data is requested from the back end.

Card developers can set this property in the manifest.
