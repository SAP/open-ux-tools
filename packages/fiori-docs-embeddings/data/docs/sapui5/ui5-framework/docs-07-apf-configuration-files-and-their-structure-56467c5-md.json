The following chapters explain the configuration on a technical level and show how the JSON files are structured and what the properties used in the configuration objects mean.\n\nThe following JSON files are relevant:\n\n-   The `manifest.json` file, which defines static information about the application.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > In SAPUI5 1.28 and prior releases, the static information was defined in the application configuration file.\n\n-   The analytical configuration file, which defines the content of the application and how it is represented on the user interface.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > We recommend not to edit the analytical configuration file manually. However, there are exceptions such as a mass change of OData service paths.\n\n\nThe configuration options include the following tasks:\n\n-   Changing the analytical configuration file\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > When you want to change the analytical configuration file of a delivered application, you must first make a copy and save it to a new location.\n\n    Some possible changes to the analytical configuration file are:\n\n    -   You can change a request, which defines the access to a server resource.\n\n    -   You can change the relation between the requested data and the representations by adapting the binding.\n\n    -   You can add a category for the analysis step gallery.\n\n    -   You can add new analysis steps or adapt existing ones, for example, by replacing the request or the binding for a step.\n\n\n-   Changing text resource files\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > When you want to change a text resource file of a delivered application, you must first make a copy and save it to a new location.\n\n-   Changing the `manifest.json` file\n\n    Whenever you have changed the analytical configuration file or text resource files and have copied the files to a new location, you must ensure that the locations are adapted accordingly in the `manifest.json` file.\n\n\nThe configuration options are explained in detail in the following sections.\n\n",
