Then according network requests for the source and all preprocessor runs that modify the XML source are skipped and the source is taken from the cache.\n\nTo make sure that the cache always contains the latest view data, the cache has to be invalidated whenever the data changes that is needed for preprocessing. When the cache is invalidated, all resources are processed again and the cache gets filled with new data.\n\n> ### Caution:  \n> Parts of this feature are currently still experimental. For more information, see [API Reference: `sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView.create`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView%23methods/sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView.create). \n\nThe following data changes are handled automatically by SAPUI5:\n\n-   SAPUI5 version changes\n\n-   Descriptor file \\(`manifest.json`\\)\n\n-   Locale \\(for each locale one cached resource is being created\\)\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> For each additional component that may have an influence on the preprocessing results of the view source, like OData metadata, you have to implement the invalidation by adding additional keys to the cache configuration.\n\nThe XML view has to be loaded asynchronously.\n\n\n\n## Cache Configuration\n\nIf you want to keep things simple, you can use the following cache configuration:\n\n```xml\nvar sCalculatedCacheKey = oKeyProvider.getCacheKey();\n\nsap.ui.require(\"sap/ui/core/mvc/XMLView\", function (XMLView) {\n\tXMLView.create({\n\t\tid: \"cacheableView\",\n\t\tviewName: \"my.cacheableView\",\n\t\tcache: {\n\t\t\t// one key is mandatory\n\t\t\tkeys:[sCalculatedCacheKey]\n\t\t}\n\t}).then(function (oXmlView) {\n\t\t// ...\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nIf you want to pass on multiple keys, for example strings or promises that resolve with a string, you use the following syntax:\n\n```xml\nvar pCalculatedCacheKey = oKeyProvider1.getCacheKeyPromise();\nvar sAnotherKey = oKeyProvider2.getCacheKey();\n\nsap.ui.require(\"sap/ui/core/mvc/XMLView\", function (XMLView) {\n\tXMLView.create({\n\t\tid: \"cacheableView\",\n\t\tviewName: \"my.cacheableView\",\n\t\tcache: {\n\t\t\tkeys: [\n\t\t\t// several key providers, at least one\n\t\t\tpCalculatedCacheKeyPromise,\n\t\t\tsAnotherKey\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t}).then(function (oXmlView) {\n\t\t// ...\n\t});\n});\n```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio3d85d5eec1594be0a71236d5e61f89aa__ViewCache_Preprocessor\"/>\n\n## Preprocessor Integration\n\nIf you want to implement a preprocessor that has influence on the creation of views, for example, by changing the XML code, you can use function `getCacheKey`. With this function, the view can find out whether the preprocessor triggers changes that invalidate the cache. The function returns a cache key or a promise that resolves a cache key. For more information, see [API Reference: `sap.ui.core.mvc.View.Preprocessor`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.mvc.View.Preprocessor). \n\n```xml\n// Example preprocessor implementation\nsap.ui.define(['sap/ui/base/Object'],\n\tfunction(BaseObject) {\n\t\t'use strict';\n\n\t\tvar TestPreprocessor = BaseObject.extend(\"smy.TestPreprocessor\", {});\n\n\t\tTestPreprocessor.process = function(vSource, sCaller, mSettings) {\n\t\t\treturn doSomething(vSource));\n\t\t};\n\n\t\tTestPreprocessor.getCacheKey = function(oViewInfo) {\n\t\t\treturn sCacheKey;\n\t\t};\n\n\t\treturn TestPreprocessor;\n\n\t});\n```\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[API Reference: `sap.ui.xmlview`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui/methods/sap.ui.xmlview)\n\n[Preprocessing XML Views](preprocessing-xml-views-48b81b9.md \"Applying preprocessing to views enables you to use features like XML templating. This feature is currently only enabled for XML views. On an abstract level, preprocessing means that a view can be modified during runtime before it is rendered. This makes it possible to use the templating syntax, as it is interpreted by the preprocessor. It also makes it possible to apply user customization.\")\n\n",
