This setting ensures that the table in the specified section adapts to the condensed layout.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> -   Condensed mode is applicable only to grid tables `(sap.ui.table)` and not to responsive tables `(sap.m.table)`.\n> \n> -   The application must run in compact mode. If it runs in cozy mode, the class is not set, even if the manifest key is set to `true`.\n> \n> -   On the object page, the `condensedTableLayout` class can be set only if there is just one section that contains a grid table \\(`sap.ui.table`\\) or if the icon tab bar is used for navigation between sections, and any section has only one table in it. Otherwise, the class is not applied for the grid table \\(`sap.ui.table`\\), even if the manifest key is set to `true`.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiof3cc057e405c4fd58ee2ed42c557797c__section_kbq_xy1_hdc\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V2\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> Object Page Table\n> \n> ```\n> \"ObjectPage|STTA_C_MP_Product\": {\n>                                         \"entitySet\": \"STTA_C_MP_Product\",\n>                                         \"component\": {\n>                                                \"name\": \"sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ObjectPage\",\n>                                                \"settings\": {\n>                                                      \"sections\": {\n>                                                              \"to_ProductText::com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem\": {\n>                                                                    \"condensedTableLayout\": true,\n>                                                             }\n>                                                      }\n>                                                }\n>                                         }\n> \n> ```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiof3cc057e405c4fd58ee2ed42c557797c__section_xq3_1z1_hdc\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> Object Page Table\n> \n> ```\n> \"SalesOrderManageObjectPageCondensedTable\": {\n> \t\"type\": \"Component\",\n> \t\"id\": \"SalesOrderManageObjectPage\",\n> \t\"name\": \"sap.fe.templates.ObjectPage\",\n> \t\"options\": {\n> \t\t\"settings\": {\n> \t\t\t\"contextPath\": \"/SalesOrderManage\",\n> \t\t\t...\n> \t\t\t},\n> \t\t\t\"controlConfiguration\": {\n> \t\t\t\t\"_Item/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem\": {\n> \t\t\t\t\t\"tableSettings\": {\n> \t\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"GridTable\",\n> \t\t\t\t\t\t\"condensedTableLayout\": true,\n> \t\t\t\t\t}\n> \t\t\t\t}\n> \t\t\t}\n> \t\t}\n> }\n> ```\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Content Densities](../04_Essentials/content-densities-e54f729.md \"The devices used to run apps that are developed with SAPUI5 run on various different operating systems and have very different screen sizes.
