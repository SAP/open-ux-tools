However, if you implement your own `createContent` function, you need to handle this yourself. The following two options exist:\n\n-   Set the `sap.ui5/autoPrefixId` attribute in the `manifest.json` file to `true`. This is the easiest option.\n\n-   Use the `createId` function of the UI component to prefix the respective ID of a view, element, or control yourself.\n\n\nUse the `byId` function of the UI component to retrieve the views, controls, and elements that have been created in a UI component.\n\n",
