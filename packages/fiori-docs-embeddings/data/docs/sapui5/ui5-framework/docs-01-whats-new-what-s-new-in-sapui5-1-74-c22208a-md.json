The set value is then not included in PATCH and POST requests to create the new entity.\n-   Annotation targets for \\(overloaded\\) bound operations in 4.01 Format are also supported in value list metadata.\n\n> ### Restriction:  \n> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Double-check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \\(such as tree binding\\). This also applies to smart controls \\(`sap.ui.comp` library\\) that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported in combination with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).\n\nFor more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.74</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2020-01-30\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.74 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Avatar`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Avatar`**\n\nWe've added *remove* and *reveal* actions in the `Avatar` design-time metadata.

Its purpose is to give an overview of a single entity \\(a person, for example\\). It consists of an interactive calendar, legend, and a schedule. For more information, see [Calendar Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/calendar) in the Card Explorer.\n-   We have enabled Data Sources to be used in the descriptor for `sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`. Data Sources are named and reusable manifest entities that hold configuration settings for services. Referenced using special double-bracketed syntax, they are used to construct data request URLs. Data Sources are defined in the `sap.app` part of the manifest. For more information, see [Data Sources](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/dataSources) in the Card Explorer.\n-   We have introduced new number formatters to represent the data on the UI in human-readable format. Now we have predefined number formatters for:\n\n    -   Currency\n    -   Date and Time\n    -   Floating-point numbers\n    -   Integers\n    -   Percent\n    -   Units of measurement\n\n    For more information, see [Card Formatters](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/formatters) in the Card Explorer.\n\n-   We now also support objects as values for manifest parameters. Until now only string values were supported. For more information, see [Manifest Parameters](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/manifestParameters) section in the Card Explorer.\n-   We have introduced a new experimental type of card - Adaptive Card. With this type of card, you can visualize and reuse cards created using the Microsoft Adaptive Cards specification and manifest, while achieving fully adapted SAP Fiori 3 user experience, out of the box. For more information, see [Adaptive Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/adaptive) in the Card Explorer.\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.74</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2020-01-30\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.74 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout`**\n\nYou can now move the corresponding section numbers that are displayed in the `AnchorBar` when using UI adaptation at runtime.For more information, see the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout).\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.74</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2020-01-30\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.74 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSAP Fiori Elements \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAP Fiori Elements** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAP Fiori Elements**\n\n**List Report and Object Page**\n\n-   **Smart Multi-Input Control in Smart Tables** \n\n    It is now possible to include a smart multi-input field in a smart table on an object page.
