In contrast to the Integration Card, `sap.f.Card` provides more freedom in choosing the structure and the controls you can include, so that you can compose the card content area according to your needs. It enables you to decide and compose the card content area according to your needs.\n\nThe `sap.f.Card` consists of three elements: a container with background color and rounded corners, a header, and content areas.\n\n![](images/sap_f_Card_Example_b1ff765.png)\n\nFor more information, see [Cards](../10_More_About_Controls/cards-5b46b03.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.Card) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.Card/sample/sap.f.sample.Card).\n\n<sub>New•Control•Info Only•1.64</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-03-28\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.64 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nNew \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Rule Builder: AST based DMN SFEEL** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Rule Builder: AST based DMN SFEEL**\n\nThe rule builder now supports a new expression language: AST based DMN SFEEL.

Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \\(such as tree binding\\). This also applies to smart controls \\(`sap.ui.comp` library\\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).\n\nFor more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.64</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-03-28\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.64 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.DynamicPage`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.DynamicPage`**\n\nWe have redesigned the content area of the `DynamicPageTitle` control so that the width of the `expandedContent` and `snappedContent` aggregations no longer depends on the width of the `heading` aggregation.

This feature allows you to group items by certain characteristics, and to display a header. New group can be created in two ways:\n\n-   If data binding is used, grouping is defined on the sorter in data binding.\n-   Alternatively, you can add a group header programmatically as an instance of `sap.ui.core.SeparatorItem` with a text property by adding it to the items aggregation of the `sap.m.ComboBox` control. This transforms the `sap.ui.core.SeparatorItem` internally to `sap.m.GroupHeaderListItem`, and uses the text value as the header of the group.\n\nIn case a `sap.ui.core.SeparatorItem` without a defined text property is inserted in the aggregation items, the ComboBox will display only a horizontal separator without any text.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.ComboBox) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.ComboBox/sample/sap.m.sample.ComboBoxGrouping). \n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.64</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-03-28\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.64 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.DatePicker`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.DatePicker`**\n\nWith the new `isValidValue` function, you can receive information on the validity of the latest value provided in `sap.m.DatePicker`, not only on change but at any time, so that you can act upon an incorrectly entered date.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.DatePicker) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.DatePicker/sample/sap.m.sample.DatePicker).\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.64</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-03-28\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.64 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Input / sap.m.ComboBoxBase` \\(Experimental\\)** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Input / sap.m.ComboBoxBase` \\(Experimental\\)**\n\nWe have introduced a new experimental method `showItems(fnFilter)`.
