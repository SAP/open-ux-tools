Content specified in the aggregations is automatically positioned in dedicated sections of the header or the footer of the pages.\n\nThere are two separate and non-dependent `semantic` namespaces in the main SAPUI5 libraries:\n\n-   `sap.f.semantic`\n\n-   `sap.m.semantic`\n\n\nBoth of them extend and enhance the base pages of the library they are in - `sap.m.Page` and `sap.f.DynamicPage`. They allow app developers to quickly add controls to the page that correspond to common operations, such as add, delete and filter. They only have to specify the action type, and the required styling and positioning is automatically added internally.\n\n",
