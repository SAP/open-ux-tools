Technically this file is a mapping between the request path \\(below the context path of the application\\) and the last modified time stamp.\n\nThe server instructs the client to cache all the above resources \\(not using the 304/not modified mechanism\\). For the index file we are using the 304/not modified mechanism to avoid to load when it has not been changed.\n\nOn the client side, we initially load this file of the application when enabled via configuration option `sap-ui-app-cache-buster` and use this for the XHR requests. If the request path is contained in the above mentioned index file we simply add the time stamp as leading path segment to this request. If the time stamp doesn't change the URL is unique and therefore it will be taken from cache. Once the file is modified the URL parameter will be changed and therefore loaded again from the back end.\n\nThe server has to delete the time stamp from this URL to look up the file properly. For SAP NetWeaver AS for ABAP, the logic is implemented in the ICF handler. Both back end implementations, SAP NetWeaver AS for Java and SAP NetWeaver AS for ABAP, also generate the index file on-the-fly.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The application cache buster does **not** work across application borders. If you require resources from another application they are not loaded via this mechanism.\n\n",
