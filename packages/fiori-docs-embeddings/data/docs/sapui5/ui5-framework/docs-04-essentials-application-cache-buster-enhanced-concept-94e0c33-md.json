The enhanced concept supports the transformation of URLs for `sap.ui.dom.includeScript`, `sap.ui.dom.includeStyleSheet`, and properties of the type `sap.ui.core/URI`. Additionally the enhanced concept allows to register components or base URLs which are considered by the Application Cache Buster. This base URL is used to load the index file with the timestamp information.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio94e0c33e22474538a65f5f5b4920cdaf__section_N10028_N10011_N10001\"/>\n\n## Registration of external URLs\n\nIf you do not specify all the applications in the bootstrap configuration, you can also register them during runtime. To register additional locations, use the following API:\n\n```js\n\nsap.ui.core.AppCacheBuster.register(\"/sap/bc/my/other/component\");\n```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio94e0c33e22474538a65f5f5b4920cdaf__section_N1003A_N10011_N10001\"/>\n\n## Avoid handling of specific URLs\n\nTo avoid handling of specific URLs, you can override the default behavior as follows:\n\n```js\n\nsap.ui.core.AppCacheBuster.handleURL = function(sURL) {\n  return sURL !== \"my/specific/url\";\n};\n```\n\n",
