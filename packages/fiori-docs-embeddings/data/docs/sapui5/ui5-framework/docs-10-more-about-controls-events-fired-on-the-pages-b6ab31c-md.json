The direct child controls often are views. In this case, the events are fired on the views, and not on a page control that is contained in the view. Thus, the event is not fired **by** the child control, but by the `NavContainer` **on** the child control \\(whatever type it is\\). This causes the different registration compared to normal control events.\n\nBefore the navigation animation starts, the `NavContainer` fires the following events:\n\n-   `beforeHide` on the page which is about to be left\n-   `beforeFirstShow` on the page which is about to be shown; this event is only fired if the respective page has not been shown before\n-   `beforeShow` on the page which is about to be shown\n\nThese events can be used to create or update the user interface of the new page and to stop any activity, such as animations or repeated data polling, on the page which is left.\n\nAfter the navigation has been completed and the new page has covered the whole screen, the following events are fired:\n\n-   `afterShow` on the page which is now shown\n-   `afterHide` on the page which has been left\n\nYou can destroy the hidden page, and the now active page can start its activity.\n\nYou can use the `addEventDelegate` function to register to these events. This function is available on every control.\n\n```js\n\npage1.addEventDelegate({\n   onBeforeShow: function(evt) {\n      // page1 is about to be shown; act accordingly - if required you can read event information from the evt object\n   },\n   onAfterHide: function(evt) {\n      // ...\n   }\n});\n```\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[API Reference: `sap.m.NavContainerChild`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.NavContainerChild)\n\n",
