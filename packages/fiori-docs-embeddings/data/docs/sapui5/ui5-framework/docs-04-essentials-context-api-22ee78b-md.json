If `true`, the context is kept alive even when it is removed from its binding's collection, for example if a filter is applied and the entity represented by this context does not match the filter criteria. Note that the `refresh` and `requestSideEffects` methods are currently not supported for kept-alive contexts.\n\n-   `setProperty` asynchronously sets a property value or an instance annotation. This is even possible without reading data first, in which case `If-Match : *` is used. You can also set a property without sending a PATCH request by using `null` as a group ID, but only if data has been read before.\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> For `getObject` and `requestObject`, the data is cloned if the given path points to a non-primitive type. This ensures that internal OData model values cannot be modified.\n> \n> When a property is read in external format, the format is solely determined by the type defined in the OData meta data of the property, and not by the type or formatter specified for the binding.\n\n```js\n\n// assume oEvent is an event fired when a button is pressed in an item of a table bound to /SalesOrderList\nsOrderID = oEvent.getSource().getBindingContext().getProperty(\"SalesOrderID\"); // the SalesOrderID in the same item\n\n// get a value in external format e.g. \"1.234,23\" instead of 1234.23\nsGrossAmount = oEvent.getSource().getBindingContext().getProperty(\"GrossAmount\", true);\n```\n\nFor more information, see [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context) in the Demo Kit.\n\n",
