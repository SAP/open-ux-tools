Everything is already included in the initial app and you can reference the data in every step. You can view and download the samples for all steps in the Demo Kit at [Ice Cream Machine](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.tutorial.icecream).\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Please keep in mind that we will not explain every single step of SAPUI5 application development, as we are focusing on selected controls. We will not cover topics like data binding, navigation, or the MVC pattern. For more information about these topics, see [Essentials](../04_Essentials/essentials-ec699e0.md).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio9631f539c4064aa09d67ffbd21d3db9b__section_al1_cch_h1b\"/>\n\n## Creating an app\n\nYou can do this tutorial with SAP Web IDE \\(from SAPUI5 version 1.50\\) or with your own development environment. Just download the initial version of the final app from the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.tutorial.icecream), extract the archive, and start coding.\n\nFor more information check the [Downloading Code for a Tutorial Step](get-started-setup-tutorials-and-demo-apps-8b49fc1.md#loio8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218__tutorials_download) section of the tutorials overview page [Get Started: Setup, Tutorials, and Demo Apps](get-started-setup-tutorials-and-demo-apps-8b49fc1.md).\n\n",
