The framework can only find an extension if the artifact names are correctly maintained in the manifest.json.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The framework does not validate the existence of artifacts mentioned in `sap.ui5/extends/extensions/`. Therefore, no error will be shown if a name is misspelled.\n\n\n\n### Missing owner component\n\nThe second possibility is also easily solvable by making sure that your views, fragments, or controllers are created in the correct owner-component scope.\n\nThe owner component is the \\(UI\\)Component which \"owns\" a view, fragment, or controller. It must provide the extension information in its manifest.json.\n\nFor a detailed explanation of the owner-component concept and some coding samples, see the **Related Information**.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[The Owner Component](the-owner-component-a7a3138.md \"If you wish to extend your view or controller, you must define the extension in the manifest.json of their owner component.\")\n\n[`sap.ui.core.Component.getOwnerComponentFor`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Component/methods/sap.ui.core.Component.getOwnerComponentFor)\n\n[`sap.ui.core.Component.prototype.runAsOwner`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Component/methods/runAsOwner)\n\n[`sap.ui.core.Component.getOwnerIdFor`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Component/methods/sap.ui.core.Component.getOwnerIdFor)\n\n",
