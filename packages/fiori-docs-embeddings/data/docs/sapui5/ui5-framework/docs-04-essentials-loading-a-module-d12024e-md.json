Be aware, that synchronous requests are already deprecated in some modern browsers and may not be supported in future. It is a better practice to load modules asynchronously.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiod12024e38385472a89c1ad204e1edb48__section_cvl_zlx_dz\"/>\n\n## Synchronous Retrieval of a Single Module Value\n\nWhen calling `sap.ui.require` with a single string as argument, the respective module has to be loaded already.\n\nIf the module is not yet loaded or it is not a SAPUI5 module \\(third-party module\\), the return value is `undefined`.\n\nBy using `sap.ui.require`, you can synchronously access modules without triggering a loading request in case the module is not present.\n\n```js\n// If JSONModel class is loaded, it is returned. If the module is not loaded yet, there will be no additional loading request.\n// The variable JSONModel might be undefined after making this call.\nvar JSONModel = sap.ui.require(\"sap/ui/model/json/JSONModel\");\n```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiod12024e38385472a89c1ad204e1edb48__section_r1s_5mx_dz\"/>\n\n## Loading Dependencies\n\nYou can load dependencies at different points in time.\n\n\n\n### Constructor and `init`\n\nIf a module is needed during the constructor call or initialization of a class, you declare the dependency as a static dependency in the `sap.ui.define` call.\n\nIf the dependency is required in the constructor, the instantiation is of course delayed until the dependency is loaded.\n\n\n\n### User interaction\n\nSome modules can be required dynamically on user interaction. An example could be a dialog, which is not needed in most cases, but needs to be loaded only in case the user performs a certain interaction.\n\nOther modules might be required dynamically while a data request is running to minimize the overall load time, as the user has to wait on the data anyway.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiod12024e38385472a89c1ad204e1edb48__section_a5y_knx_dz\"/>\n\n## Checking the Availability of Modules\n\nThe `sap.ui.require` function can not only be used to load modules, but also to check the availability of modules.\n\nThe return value of the following function call is either a reference on the already loaded module or `undefined`. If `undefined` is returned, the module was not loaded yet and the `sap.ui.require` call without a callback function will not trigger a load.\n\n```js\nvar ModuleInQuestion = sap.ui.require(\"name/of/module/in/Question\");\n```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiod12024e38385472a89c1ad204e1edb48__section_blt_qnx_dz\"/>\n\n## `instanceof` Checks\n\nSince the above `sap.ui.require` call retrieves a module reference, you can use the reference not only to instantiate instances of classes but also to perform JavaScript instanceof checks.\n\n```js\nsap.ui.define(['sap/ui/core/mvc/View', 'sap/ui/core/Fragment'], function(View, Fragment) {\n    ...\n    if (oControl instanceof View) {\n        ...\n    } else if (oControl instanceof Fragment) {\n        ...\n    }\n});\n```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiod12024e38385472a89c1ad204e1edb48__section_f3y_tnt_3mb\"/>\n\n## Checks for Dynamically Required Modules\n\nYou can use one of the following approaches to perform a type check on your module:\n\nIf the module is a descendant of `sap.ui.base.Object`, the object method `isA` can be used. With this approach the respective class does not need to be loaded. Furthermore, it is possible to check multiple classes by passing the respective class names as an array to the `isA` method. In scenarios where it's unproven that the module is a descendant of `sap.ui.base.Object`, the static method `sap.ui.base.Object.isA` can be used, which checks for descendance from `sap.ui.base.Object`.\n\n```js\nsap.ui.define(['sap/ui/base/Object'], function(Object) {\n    ...\n    if (oControl.isA('sap.ui.core.mvc.View')) {\n        ...\n    } else if (Object.isA(oControl, ['sap.ui.core.Fragement', 'sap.ui.core.Control'])) {\n        ...\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIf it's proven that the respective class is not a descendant of `sap.ui.base.Object`, the `instanceof` approach can be enhanced. To perform an `instanceof` check, the respective class does not need to be loaded. If the class module is not loaded, there can never be an instance of that class. The `sap.ui.require` call returns `undefined` in case the module is not loaded.\n\nThe `lazyInstanceOf` convenience function makes sure that the `instanceof` check is performed against a function and not `undefined`, in case the module or class was not loaded yet.\n\n```js\n\nfunction lazyInstanceof(obj, module) {\n    var FNClass = sap.ui.require(module);\n    return typeof FNClass === 'function' ? obj instanceof FNClass : false;\n}\n  \nif (lazyInstanceof(oControl, 'sap/ui/base/DataType')) {\n                â€¦\n}\n```\n\n",
