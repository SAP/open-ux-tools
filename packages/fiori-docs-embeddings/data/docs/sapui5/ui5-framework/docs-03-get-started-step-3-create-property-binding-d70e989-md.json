The curly brackets enclosing a binding path \\(binding syntax\\) are automatically interpreted as a binding. These binding instances are called property bindings. In this scenario, the control's `text` property is bound to the `greetingText` property at the root of the default model. The slash \\(`/`\\) at the beginning of the binding path signifies an absolute binding path.\n\n**webapp/view/App.view.xml**\n\n```\n<mvc:View\n\txmlns=\"sap.m\"\n\txmlns:mvc=\"sap.ui.core.mvc\">\n\t<Text text=\"{/greetingText}\"/>\n</mvc:View>\n```\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Binding Types](../04_Essentials/binding-types-91f0d8a.md \"Depending on the different use cases, you can use different binding types: Propety binding, context binding, and list binding.\")\n\n[Property Binding](../04_Essentials/property-binding-91f0652.md \"With property binding, you can initialize properties of a control automatically and update them based on the data of the model.\")\n\n",
