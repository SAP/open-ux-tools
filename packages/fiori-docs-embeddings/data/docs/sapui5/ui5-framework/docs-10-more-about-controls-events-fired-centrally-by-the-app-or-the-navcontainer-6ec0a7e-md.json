The `navigate` event is fired before the transition animation starts, and the `afterNavigate` event is fired when the animation has been completed.\n\nThe events contain a lot of information about the page that is left and the target page of the navigation, as well as what kind of navigation is happening.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n\napp.attachNavigate(function(evt) {\n   var isBack = !evt.getParameter(\"isTo\"); // there are several types of back animation, but we want the general direction only\n   alert(\"Navigating \" + (isBack ? \"back \" : \"\") + \" to page \" + evt.getParameter(\"toId\"));\n});\n```\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[API Reference event: `afterNavigate`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.NavContainer/events/afterNavigate)\n\n[API Reference event: `navigate`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.NavContainer/events/navigate)\n\n",
