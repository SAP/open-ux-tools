You can then delete it from the list. Note, however, that an application is always deleted along with all configurations assigned to it.\n\nTo delete an object of an application, select it in the tree structure and click *Delete*. Note the following:\n\n-   Deleting a configuration always includes all subordinate objects.\n\n-   Deleting a category also deletes those steps that are not assigned to any other category. Steps that are also assigned to other categories are not deleted.\n\n-   Deleting a step removes it from any category it is assigned to. To remove a step from a particular category without deleting it altogether, select the step and remove the category assignment from the *Category Title* field.\n\n\n",
