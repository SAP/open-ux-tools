No entries for the context resolution are required.\n\nYou can configure whether multiple selections are possible in the value help or not. If multiple selections are possible you can specify one or several values that are used as default values or you can enter a function that determines the default values. If you select *Automatic Values*, all values are selected in the filter by default.\n\nIf only single selection is allowed, you can specify one value that is used as default value or you can enter a function that determines the default value. If you select *Automatic Values*, the first entry in the value help of the filter is automatically selected by default.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If you specify default values that do not exist in the value help, these values will occur in the filter in addition to the values provided by the value help request.\n\nThe option described above is depicted in the following figure:\n\n![](images/Facet_Filter_Configuration_Use_Case_1_d550224.png)\n\n",
