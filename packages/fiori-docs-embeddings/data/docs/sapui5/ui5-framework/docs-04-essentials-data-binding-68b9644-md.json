Data binding defines how models and views communicate with each other.\n\nDepending on which external data source you use, you can choose between different model types to represent it. SAPUI5 supports OData V4, OData V2, JSON, and XML models.\n\nThere are also internal data sources that are defined in the app for specific purposes. For those, an app contains the following models:\n\n-   The **resource model** is used in communication with the resource bundle that contains translatable texts in multiple languages.\n\n-   **View models** can be, for example, JSON models that communicate with a corresponding JSON object. JSON data can also be edited in the app, but they are not stored - as soon as you refresh the browser or restart the app, the changes are reset.\n\n-   A JSON model can be used together with the `sap/ui/Device` module to create a **device model** that contains device-specific settings. For an example, see our Walkthrough tutorial, [Step 35: Device Adaptation](../03_Get-Started/step-35-device-adaptation-d63a15e.md).\n\n\nMost of the models are client-side models. This means that all data is initially loaded to the model when the app is started. All actions performed on the data are only executed on the client, and are only sent back to the data source when this is triggered by the app. Client-side models are therefore only recommended for small data sets.\n\nThe OData models \\(V2 and V4\\) are server-side models, which means that data is provided by a back-end system on demand. Filtering, sorting, and paging actions are performed on the server. This means, for example, that you don't have to load a complete table on the UI to be able to sort the entries.\n\nIn the view, you bind data by specifying the **binding path** for a control. You can use **data types** and **formatters** to validate and format the data on the UI.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> To learn more about data binding, take this tutorial: [Data Binding Tutorial](../03_Get-Started/data-binding-tutorial-e531093.md).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio68b9644a253741e8a4b9e4279a35c247__section_BindingModes\"/>\n\n## Binding Modes: One-way Binding, Two-way Binding, and One-time Binding\n\nThe binding mode defines how the data sources are bound to the UI. SAPUI5 provides the following binding modes:\n\n-   **One-way binding** means a binding from the model to the view. Any value changes in the model update all corresponding bindings and the view.\n\n-   **Two-way binding** means a binding from the model to the view and from the view to the model. Any changes in the model or the view fire events that automatically trigger updates of all corresponding bindings and both the view and the model.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > Two-way binding is currently only supported for property bindings. For other binding types, such as list bindings, the creation or deletion of entities depends on the specific model.\n    > \n    > **Example:** For list bindings the OData V4 model provides the [`sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#create` method](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding/methods/create) for creating a new entity, and the [`sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#delete` method](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/delete) to delete an entity in a list. \n    > \n    > For more information on the different types of binding available, see [Binding Types](binding-types-91f0d8a.md).\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > When using formatter functions, the binding is automatically switched to \"one-way\". So you can't use a formatter function for \"two-way\" scenarios, but you can use [Data Types](formatting-parsing-and-validating-data-07e4b92.md#loio07e4b920f5734fd78fdaa236f26236d8__section_DataTypes).\n\n-   **One-time binding** means from model to view once.\n\n\nThe following table shows which binding modes are supported by the respective data models within SAPUI5:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nModel\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nOne-time\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nOne-way\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nTwo-way\n\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nOData V4 model\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif) \\(default\\)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nOData V2 model\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif) \\(default\\)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nODataMetaModel V4\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif) \\(default\\)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Not supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Red_Led_5befb5a.gif)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nODataMetaModel\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif) \\(default\\)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Not supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Red_Led_5befb5a.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Not supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Red_Led_5befb5a.gif)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nJSON model\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif) \\(default\\)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nXML model\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif) \\(default\\)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nResource model\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif) \\(default\\)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Not supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Red_Led_5befb5a.gif)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nFor more information, see the [API Reference: `sap.ui.model.BindingMode`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.BindingMode). \n\n",
