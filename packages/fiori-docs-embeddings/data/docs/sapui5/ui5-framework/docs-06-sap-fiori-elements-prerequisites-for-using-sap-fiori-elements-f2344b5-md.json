For more information about SAP Business Application Studio, see the documentation on the SAP Help Portal at [SAP Business Application Studio](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/Cloud/en-US).\n\n> ### Note:  \n> In SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, an edit scenario works only in combination with a draft-enabled service.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiof2344b5e78164b2b9c27ef8b068f295c__section_btp_xc5_tqb\"/>\n\n## Back End\n\nFor more information about building OData services, use the following links to access your required product and version:\n\n-   [SAP S/4HANA: ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model](https://help.sap.com/viewer/fc4c71aa50014fd1b43721701471913d/latest/en-US)\n\n-   [SAP BTP ABAP Environment: ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model](https://help.sap.com/viewer/923180ddb98240829d935862025004d6/Cloud/en-US/289477a81eec4d4e84c0302fb6835035.html)\n\n-   [The SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/)\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> While CAP defaults to OData V4, the latest protocol version, some projects need to fallback to OData V2, for example, to keep using existing V2-based UIs.\n\nFor SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, if you're using CAP, you must ensure the security configurations in the back end are compatible with the design and configuration of your app. For more information, see [Security Configuration](security-configuration-ba0484b.md).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiof2344b5e78164b2b9c27ef8b068f295c__section_bkp_wdt_1rb\"/>\n\n## System Requirements\n\n-   The development of new transactional apps with draft capabilities requires ABAP Application Server as of SAP NetWeaver AS for ABAP 7.51 innovation package SP02 or higher. Draft capabilities are not available with SAP NetWeaver AS for ABAP 7.50. For more information, see [Draft Handling](draft-handling-ed9aa41.md).\n\n-   We recommend that you download the most up-to-date version to ensure that you have the latest features. 7.5 SP01 or higher.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiof2344b5e78164b2b9c27ef8b068f295c__section_wnb_1d5_tqb\"/>\n\n## Tutorials\n\n-   [https://developers.sap.com/group.fiori-tools-odata-v4-travel.html](https://developers.sap.com/group.fiori-tools-odata-v4-travel.html)\n-   [https://developers.sap.com/group.fiori-tools-odata-v4-incident.html](https://developers.sap.com/group.fiori-tools-odata-v4-incident.html)\n\n",
