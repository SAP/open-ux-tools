There are two options for displaying the full text, which are defined by the `overflowMode` property - in place \\(default\\) or as a popover. The `maxCharacters` property specifies the maximum number of characters from the beginning of the text field, that are shown initially.

This allows you to define properties that are fetched together with a group level, such as a text for a key. For more information, see [`sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#setAggregation`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding/methods/setAggregation) and [Data Aggregation and Recursive Hierarchy](../04_Essentials/data-aggregation-and-recursive-hierarchy-7d91431.md).\n\n-   Support of the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#requestSideEffects` method in combination with kept-alive contexts. A list binding context can be kept alive with the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#setKeepAlive` method introduced with SAPUI5 1.81.\n\n-   Evaluation of the `Org.OData.Core.V1.ContentID` instance annotation in messages of error responses to change sets, so that the message can be assigned to the correct request and the message target can be calculated correctly. For more information, see [Server Messages in the OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/server-messages-in-the-odata-v4-model-fbe1cb5.md).\n\n\nFor more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.87</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2021-02-25\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.87 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.Card`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.Card`**\n\nWe no longer apply default `min-height` in the control, which allows smaller cards to be rendered properly.

Now, similar to `sap.f.GridContainer`, the navigation with [Arrow\\] keys follows the cells of the underlying \\(virtual\\) grid. This behavior provides stable navigation paths if there are items of different sizes. When any of the borders are reached, the `borderReached` event is fired. To navigate to another `GridList`, you have two options:\n\n-   Navigate using the [Tab\\] key.\n\n-   Configure navigation with the [Arrow\\] keys. This is achieved by using the `focusItemByDirection` method and requires additional logic from the application side to determine the navigation direction in the actual app layout.\n\n\nFor more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.GridList) and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.GridList).\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.87</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2021-02-25\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.87 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.BadgeCustomData`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.BadgeCustomData`**\n\nWe have added a new `animation` property that enables you to choose the animation type to be performed by the badge element.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.BadgeCustomData).\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.87</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2021-02-25\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.87 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Dialog`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Dialog`**\n\nYou can now drag and resize the dialog using the keyboard.

To place a link as a title you have to add the [`sap.m.Link`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.Link) control to the `content` aggregation.

Based on this property, the `SmartForm` decides which `SmartFields` will be visible. This feature makes the `SmartForm` more flexible if you have limited screen real estate because it can display only the fields that are important for the user. The following options are available:\n\n-   If the `SmartForm` has `high` importance, only smart fields with `high` importance will be visible.\n\n-   If the `SmartForm` has `medium` importance, only smart fields with `high` and `medium` importance will be visible.\n\n-   If the `SmartForm` has `low` importance \\(default\\), all smart fields will be visible, regardless of their importance.\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If a `SmartField` is annotated as `mandatory` or `hidden`, its visibility is not affected by the `importance` property.\n\nThe `SmartField` importance can also be set using the `UI.Importance` annotation. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField%23annotations/Importance) in the Demo Kit. \n\nIf both the property and the annotation are set, the importance of the property is taken into account.\n\nFor more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartform.SmartForm) and the [Smart Form using Importance property Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartform.SmartForm/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartformImportance).\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.87</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2021-02-25\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.87 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`**\n\n`SmartField` now supports values that are not part of the `ComboBox` list.

The bound property of the `SmartField` value of `sap.ui.comp.smartfield.ComboBox` is `enteredValue`. In this property, we store the `selectedKey` when a selection is made inside the `ComboBox` from `sap.m.List`, or a manually entered value.
