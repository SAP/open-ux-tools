Double-check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \\(such as tree binding\\). This also applies to smart controls \\(`sap.ui.comp` library\\) that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported in combination with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).\n\nFor more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.76</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2020-03-26\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.76 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout`**\n\n-   With the new `autoFocus` property, we’ve introduced the possibility to enable/disable the autofocus functionality of the `FlexibleColumnLayout` control.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout/sample/sap.f.sample.FlexibleColumnLayoutWithOneColumnStart).\n\n-   We’ve introduced the `columnResize` event, which is fired when the resizing of each column of the control is complete.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout%23events/columnResize).\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.76</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2020-03-26\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.76 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.FacetFilter`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.FacetFilter`**\n\nOptimization regarding the initial database service query has been introduced. There are cases when the `items` aggregation for the `FacetFilterList` could take a long time fetching data from the database service. Now we have added а `search` event, that fires when the `FacetFilterList` is opened. This enables developers to register a handler function to prevent the default filtering behavior by calling the `sap.ui.base.Event.prototype.preventDefault` function. As a result, no list items are loaded initially. In this case, the developers have to define the filtering behavior at the application level inside the `search` event handler function.

If `ControlConfiguration` exists in the `SmartFilterBar` for that field, the value of the annotation is ignored and the value from the `ControlConfiguration` is used. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar%23annotations/Summary).\n\n-   When the `SmartFilterBar` is used inside a `ValueHelpDialog`, if a property is annotated with `Hidden`, it’s not rendered but is used as a filter to restrict the query result from OData that is shown in the table.

This property defines the data type of the parameter. Currently the `type` property is used only in UI adaptation at design time. For more information, see the [Manifest Parameters](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/manifestParameters) section in the Card Explorer.\n-   We have added support for the destinations to be resolved by the host environment. In the manifest, the card developer indicates the name of the destination and the request, which depends on this destination. On the host environment side, the host application developer creates a method that resolves the given destination name to a URL. For more information, see [Destinations](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/destinations) in the Card Explorer.\n-   We have introduced optional application-level Host Actions that interact with the host environment. These specific actions are displayed by the card and processed back in the host environment. For example, sharing or removing a card. For more information, see [Host Actions](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/hostActions) in the Card Explorer.\n-   A new `JsonDateTime` parser is now used to properly parse dates. Some `DateTime` values may appear in JSON files as `DateTime Wire` format strings like `/Date(700000+0500)/`. The parser automatically splits the date string into parts, taking into account the time zone offset if present, and returns a valid date object.
