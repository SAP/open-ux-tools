Viewing of the loaded images is enhanced with standard VIT pan and zoom gesture support.\n\nThe `sap.ui.vk.NativeViewport` control can occupy all or part of the user interface.\n\n\n\n## Details\n\n\n\n### Loading Images into the Native Viewport\n\nThe `NativeViewport` control supports the loading of images that are natively supported by the browser.\n\nCurrently, the `NativeViewport` control supports the loading of the following file formats:\n\n-   JPG / JPEG\n-   PNG\n-   GIF\n-   TIFF \\(not supported in all browsers\\)\n-   BMP\n-   SVG\n\nYou must specify the extension of the file you want to load. Otherwise, the file will not load.\n\nIf it can be detected, a console message will be displayed when a problem occurs during file loading.\n\n\n\n### Gesture Handling in the Native Viewport\n\nGestures such as pan and zoom are captured and processed by the `sap.ui.vk.Loco` library. A new `NativeViewport` instance is initialized with an instance of the `sap.ui.vk.Loco` library attached, so that gestures can be captured and processed.\n\n\n\n### Keyboard Shortcuts in the Native Viewport\n\nIn addition to mouse and touch gestures, keyboard shortcuts are available for navigating around the `NativeViewport` instance:\n\n**Native Viewport keyboard shortcuts**\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nKeyboard shortcut\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nFunction\n\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n[DIRECTIONAL ARROW\\]\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nPan the image.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n[\\+\\]\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nZoom into the image.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n[\\-\\]\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nZoom out of the image.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n## Constraints\n\nThe following restrictions apply:\n\n-   The `NativeViewport` control only loads 2D images. For loading 3D models, use the `sap.ui.vk.Viewport` control.\n-   Currently, the `NativeViewport` control does not support interactive SVG files; that is, any links in an SVG file will not work in the Native Viewport.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Viewport](viewport-acd3467.md \"\")\n\n",
