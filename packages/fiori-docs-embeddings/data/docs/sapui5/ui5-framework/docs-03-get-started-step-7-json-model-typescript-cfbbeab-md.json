The description will be directly updated as the user types.\n\n\n\n## Preview\n\n  \n  \n**An input field and a description displaying the value of the input field**\n\n![The graphic has an explanatory text](images/UI5_Walkthrough_Step_07_afc1055.png \"An input field and a description displaying the value of the input\n\t\t\t\t\tfield\")\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiocfbbeab4e4b74124abac98ce268a0aba__section_e2g_rvc_syb\"/>\n\n## Coding\n\nYou can view all files at [OpenUI5 TypeScript Walkthrough - Step 7: JSON Model](https://github.com/sap-samples/ui5-typescript-walkthrough/tree/main/steps/07) and [download the solution as a zip file](https://sap-samples.github.io/ui5-typescript-walkthrough/ui5-typescript-walkthrough-step-07.zip).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiocfbbeab4e4b74124abac98ce268a0aba__section_f2g_rvc_syb\"/>\n\n## webapp/controller/App.controller.ts\n\nWe add an `onInit` function to the controller. This is one of SAPUI5's lifecycle methods that is invoked by the framework when the controller is created, similar to the constructor of a control.\n\nInside the function we instantiate a JSON model. The data for the model only contains a single property for the \"recipient\", and inside this it also contains one additional property for the name.\n\nTo be able to use this model from within the XML view, we call the `setModel` function on the view and pass on our newly created model.\n\n```js\nimport MessageToast from \"sap/m/MessageToast\";\nimport Controller from \"sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller\";\nimport JSONModel from \"sap/ui/model/json/JSONModel\";\n\n/**\n * @name ui5.walkthrough.controller.App\n */\nexport default class AppController extends Controller {\n   onInit() : void {\n      // set data model on view\n        const data = {\n           recipient: {\n              name: \"World\"\n           }\n        };\n        const dataModel = new JSONModel(data);\n        this.getView()?.setModel(dataModel);\n    }\n\n    onShowHello(): void {\n       MessageToast.show(\"Hello World\");\n     }\n};\n```\n\nThe model is now set on the view.\n\n\n\n## webapp/view/App.view.xml\n\nWe add an `sap/m/Input` control to our view, allowing the user to enter a name for the person they want to greet.\n\nTo make this work, we connect, or \"bind\", the value of the input control to the `name` attribute of the `recipient` object in our JSON data model. We do this using a simple binding syntax, which is a straightforward way to link data of the model and the view.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> To bind a control property to your view model data, you need to specify a [`sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.PropertyBindingInfo`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.PropertyBindingInfo) for the property. A binding info is always initiated by enclosing it in curly brackets `{â€¦}`, and the properties defined in the binding info's API are placed within the brackets.\n> \n> You can omit all properties of the binding info and just provide the binding path as a simple string. A binding path consists of path segments separated by forward slashes \\(\\`/\\`\\) which point to a property in the model that you want to bind to. This applies to all SAPUI5-provided models.\n> \n> Binding paths can be either absolute or relative. Absolute binding paths start with a slash, while relative binding paths start with a name token and are resolved relative to the context of the control that is being bound \\(we'll discuss this later on\\).\n\nWe also create a greeting message by combining the static \"Hello\" text with the `name` attribute from our data model and assigning it to the `description` property of the input field. This means that the greeting message will dynamically update with whatever name the user enters. To ensure that the greeting message updates in real time as the user types, we set the `valueLiveUpdate` attribute of the input control to `true`.\n\n```xml\n<mvc:View\n   controllerName=\"ui5.walkthrough.controller.App\"\n   xmlns=\"sap.m\"\n   xmlns:mvc=\"sap.ui.core.mvc\">\n   <Button\n      text=\"Say Hello\"\n      press=\".onShowHello\"/>\n   <Input\n      value=\"{/recipient/name}\"\n      description=\"Hello {/recipient/name}\"\n      valueLiveUpdate=\"true\"\n      width=\"60%\"/>\n</mvc:View>\n```\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Model View Controller \\(MVC\\)](../04_Essentials/model-view-controller-mvc-91f2334.md \"The Model View Controller (MVC) concept is used in SAPUI5 to separate the representation of information from the user interaction.
