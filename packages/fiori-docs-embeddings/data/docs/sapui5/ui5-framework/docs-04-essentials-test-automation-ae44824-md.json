The test runner can be included in your project setup so that it is called whenever code changes are submitted.\n\nSAPUI5 does not provide features for any specific test runner but rather aims for an agnostic approach. To execute functional and integration tests, you may use a test runner of your choice with the respective configuration for QUnit and OPA5 tests. Under [UI5 community projects](https://bestofui5.org/#/packages?tokens=testing:tag) we listed alternative test runners, such as [ui5-test-runner](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/ui5-test-runner) or [wdio-qunit-service](https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/wdio-qunit-service). You might also be interested in the **UI5ers live** webcast [UI5ers live \\#44: Exploring UI5 Test Runner Alternatives - UI5 Test Runner & WDIO QUnit Service](https://youtu.be/9yKep9YmYS4), which discusses test runners.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[ui5-test-runner](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/ui5-test-runner)\n\n[wdio-qunit-service](https://github.com/github.com/mauriciolauffer/wdio-qunit-service)\n\n",
