It offers a wealth of information including comprehensive technical information, a control tree, and debugging features.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio04b75eae78ef4bae9b40cd7540ae8bdc__section_gt2_djf_c1b\"/>\n\n## Preview\n\n![](images/Diagnostics_Window_5ceb62a.png)\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio04b75eae78ef4bae9b40cd7540ae8bdc__section_r2s_vkf_c1b\"/>\n\n## Opening the Example App and the Diagnostics Window\n\n1.  Download the example app with errors from the Demo Kitat [Troubleshooting](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.core.tutorial.troubleshooting/sample/sap.ui.core.tutorial.troubleshooting.01) and run the app.\n\n2.  Open the *Diagnostics* window by pressing [Ctrl\\] + [Shift\\] + [Alt\\] + [S\\] .\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio04b75eae78ef4bae9b40cd7540ae8bdc__section_p3z_kmf_c1b\"/>\n\n## Improving App Performance\n\nLet's say that you are facing a performance issue in your app, so let's check some performance-relevant settings in the *Diagnostics* window:\n\n1.  Expand the *Technical Information* section and scroll down to view the loaded libraries.\n\n2.  If you spot any libraries that you originally defined, but you don't actually use, remove them from the `manifest.json` file in your development environment to prevent them from loading. In this case, you can see that the example app loads the `sap.ui.layout` library, even though the `layout` control is not used.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio04b75eae78ef4bae9b40cd7540ae8bdc__section_xgg_qnf_c1b\"/>\n\n## Simulating UI Changes\n\nThe app contains a *Do Something* button and you want to make the button bigger. The control tree allows you to test which width is the best.\n\n1.  Expand the *Control Tree* section. Make sure that you display both the app and the *Diagnostics* windows side-by-side or on different monitors. Otherwise the diagnostics window will go to the background.\n\n2.  Press and hold the [Ctrl\\] + [Shift\\] + [Alt\\]  keys and click the *Do Something* button in the app. You see the button blinking green.\n\n3.  In the control tree of the *Diagnostics* window, the button is selected and you can see its properties on the right.\n\n4.  Change the value of the `width` property to `100%` and confirm with [Enter\\].\n\n    The button width is automatically increased.\n\n5.  The changes that you make in the *Diagnostics* window are only temporary. To make your change permanent, you have to change the app code.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio04b75eae78ef4bae9b40cd7540ae8bdc__section_ftz_34f_c1b\"/>\n\n## Trying Different Framework Versions\n\nIf you find a bug in your application, you can easily check whether it has already been fixed in a newer framework version:\n\n1.  Expand the *Technical Information* section and check the loaded version.\n\n2.  Expand the *Debugging* section.\n\n3.  Choose *Other* from the *Boot application with different UI5 version on next reload* dropdown list.\n\n4.  Enter a custom URL, for example `https://sdk.openui5.org/nightly/resources/sap-ui-core.js`.\n\n5.  Choose *Activate Reboot URL*, confirm the dialog box, and reload the app.\n\n6.  Reopen the *Diagnostics* window and expand the *Technical Information* section. The loaded SAPUI5 version is now changed.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio04b75eae78ef4bae9b40cd7540ae8bdc__section_fcy_kpf_c1b\"/>\n\n## More Features\n\nMore features are waiting for you to discover in the *Diagnostics* window. For more information, see [Diagnostics](../04_Essentials/diagnostics-6ec18e8.md#loio6ec18e80b0ce47f290bc2645b0cc86e6).\n\n",
