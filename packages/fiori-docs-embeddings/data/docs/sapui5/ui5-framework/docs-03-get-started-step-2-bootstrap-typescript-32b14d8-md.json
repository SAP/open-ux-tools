This process of loading and initializing SAPUI5 is called **bootstrapping**. Once this bootstrapping is finished, we simply display an alert.\n\n\n\n## Preview\n\n  \n  \n**An alert \"UI5 is ready\" is displayed**\n\n![An alert \"UI5 is ready\" is displayed](images/UI5_Walkthrough_Step_02_0f6b6b9.png \"An alert \"UI5 is ready\" is displayed\")\n\n\n\n## Coding\n\nYou can view all files at [OpenUI5 TypeScript Walkthrough - Step 2: Bootstrap](https://github.com/sap-samples/ui5-typescript-walkthrough/tree/main/steps/02) and [download the solution as a zip file](https://sap-samples.github.io/ui5-typescript-walkthrough/ui5-typescript-walkthrough-step-02.zip).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio32b14d88bd484cd7b941aae37180f732__section_mkm_zwb_syb\"/>\n\n## package.json\n\nAs we'd like to use TypeScript with our project, we first need to install the TypeScript package. It provides the necessary tools and utilities to compile TypeScript code into JavaScript.\n\nOpen a terminal in the app root folder and execute the following command:\n\n`npm install typescript --save-dev`\n\nThis installs the latest stable version of TypeScript to your project and adds it as development dependency to your `package.json`.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio32b14d88bd484cd7b941aae37180f732__section_fy4_zjy_kzb\"/>\n\n## tsconfig.json \\(New\\)\n\nLet's create the file `tsconfig.json` in the app root folder to indicate that this folder is the root of a TypeScript project. This file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.\n\nSpecify the compiler options as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n      \"target\": \"es2023\",\n      \"module\": \"es2022\",\n      \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n      \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n      \"allowJs\": true,\n      \"strict\": true,\n      \"strictPropertyInitialization\": false,\n      \"rootDir\": \"webapp\",\n      \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\n      \"paths\": {\n        \"ui5/walkthrough/*\": [\"webapp/*\"]\n      }\n    },\n    \"include\": [\"webapp/**/*\"]\n  }\n```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio32b14d88bd484cd7b941aae37180f732__section_r5p_fky_kzb\"/>\n\n## webapp/index.ts \\(New\\)\n\nCreate a new `index.ts` script in the webapp folder and add a native `alert()` method with the message \"UI5 is ready\" to it. We'll integrate this script to the `index.html` page next.\n\n```js\nalert(\"UI5 is ready\");\n```\n\n\n\n## webapp/index.html\n\nIn this step, we change the `index.html` page to make it load the SAPUI5 framework from the webserver provided by UI5 Tooling. We initialize the core modules with the following configuration options:\n\n-   The `id` attribute of the `<script>` tag has to be exactly `\"sap-ui-bootstrap\"` to ensure proper booting of the SAPUI5 runtime.\n-   The `src` attribute of the `<script>` tag tells the browser where to find the SAPUI5 core library â€“ it initializes the SAPUI5 runtime and loads additional resources, such as the theme specified in the `data-sap-ui-theme` attribute.\n\n-   The SAPUI5 controls support different themes. We choose `sap_horizon` as our default theme.\n\n-   To make use of the most recent functionality of SAPUI5 we define the compatibility version as `edge`.\n\n-   We configure the bootstrapping process to run asynchronously. This means that the SAPUI5 resources can be loaded simultaneously in the background for performance reasons.\n\n-   With the `data-sap-ui-on-init` attribute, we define that the `ui5/walkthrough/index` module is to be loaded initially in a declarative way. With this, we avoid directly executable JavaScript code in the HTML file. This makes our app more secure. Note that the path to our file includes the namespace, whereby the \".\" characters are replaced by \"/\" \\(see explanation below\\). We've created the `index.ts` script that this attribute refers to already in the previous step.\n-   The `data-sap-ui-resource-roots` attribute lets you map a namespace to a specific path. We define the`ui5.walkthrough` namespace and map it relative to the location of `index.html`. In this way, we tell the SAPUI5 core that resources in the `ui5.walkthrough` namespace are located in the same folder as `index.html`.\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n\t<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n\t<title>UI5 TypeScript Walkthrough</title>\n\t<script\n\t\tid=\"sap-ui-bootstrap\"\n\t\tsrc=\"resources/sap-ui-core.js\"\n\t\tdata-sap-ui-theme=\"sap_horizon\"\n\t\tdata-sap-ui-compat-version=\"edge\"\n\t\tdata-sap-ui-async=\"true\"\n\t\tdata-sap-ui-on-init=\"module:ui5/walkthrough/index\"\n\t\tdata-sap-ui-resource-roots='{\n\t\t\t\"ui5.walkthrough\": \"./\"\n\t\t}'>\n\t</script>\n</head>\n<body>\n\t<div>Hello World</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio32b14d88bd484cd7b941aae37180f732__section_ks2_1bv_xfb\"/>\n\n## package.json\n\nNow it's time to enhance our tooling setup once again. This time we install some custom middleware for the ui5-server to facilitate the handling of our development project.\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to the app root folder. Then execute the following command:\n\n`npm install ui5-middleware-livereload ui5-middleware-serveframework ui5-tooling-transpile --save-dev`\n\nThis will install the `ui5-middleware-livereload`, `ui5-middleware-serveframework`, and `ui5-tooling-transpile` tooling extensions and add them as development dependencies to your `package.json`:\n\n-   `ui5-middleware-livereload` is a middleware for ui5-server which triggers a live reload whenever files inside your directory change, e.g. upon *Save*.\n-   `ui5-middleware-serveframework` is a middleware for ui5-server which delivers the SAPUI5 framework from a locally built version.\n-   `ui5-tooling-transpile` is a plugin for UI5 Tooling that transpiles mordern JavaScript \\(ES6+\\) and TypeScript into SAPUI5-compatible code. SAPUI5 is based on older versions of JavaScript, so this plugin allows you to take advantage of the latest language features and syntax while ensuring that your code remains compatible with SAPUI5.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio32b14d88bd484cd7b941aae37180f732__section_hhn_jky_kzb\"/>\n\n## ui5.yaml\n\nNext, we need to do some additional configuration work for our UI5 Tooling setup.\n\nOpen a terminal in the app root folder and execute the following commands:\n\n-   `ui5 use OpenUI5` \n\n    This configures the latest OpenUI5 version in your UI5 Tooling setup.\n\n-   `ui5 add sap.ui.core themelib_sap_horizon`\n\n    This adds the `sap.ui.core` and `themelib_sap_horizon` libraries as dependencies to your `ui5.yaml` file.\n\n\nNext, we have to configure the tooling extensions we installed from npm in our UI5 Tooling setup, so we can use them in our project. To hook a custom task into a certain build phase of a project, it needs to reference another task that will get executed before or after it. The same applies for a custom middleware:\n\n-   For the `ui5-tooling-transpile-task` we specify that this should happen after the`replaceVersion` task.\n-   All our custom middleware extensions will be called after the `compression` middleware.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Middleware configurations are applied in the order in which they are defined.\n\n```\nframework:\n  name: OpenUI5\n  version: \"1.136.0\"\n  libraries:\n    - name: sap.ui.core\n    - name: themelib_sap_horizon\nbuilder:\n  customTasks:\n  - name: ui5-tooling-transpile-task\n    afterTask: replaceVersion\nserver:\n  customMiddleware:\n  - name: ui5-tooling-transpile-middleware\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n  - name: ui5-middleware-serveframework\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n  - name: ui5-middleware-livereload\n    afterMiddleware: compression\n```\n\nNow you can benefit from live reload on changes, built framework resources at development time, and make use of TypeScript in SAPUI5!\n\n> ### Note:  \n> During its initial run, the `ui5-middleware-serveframework` middleware will build the framework, which can take a while. In all following steps, the build will not happen again and the framework is served from the built resources.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[What is a tsconfig.json?](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)\n\n[Bootstrapping: Loading and Initializing](../04_Essentials/bootstrapping-loading-and-initializing-a04b0d1.md \"To use SAPUI5 features in your HTML page, you have to load and initialize the SAPUI5 library.\")\n\n[Content Security Policy](../05_Developing_Apps/content-security-policy-fe1a6db.md \"Content Security Policy (CSP) adds an additional layer of security that can detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting and data injection.\")\n\n[UI5 Tooling: Consuming OpenUI5 Libaries](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/v3/pages/OpenUI5/)\n\n[NPM Package: `ui5-middleware-livereload`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-livereload)\n\n[NPM Package: `ui5-middleware-serveframework`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-middleware-serveframework)\n\n[NPM Package: `ui5-tooling-transpile`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-tooling-transpile)\n\n[UI5 Tooling: Custom Tasks](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/v3/pages/extensibility/CustomTasks/)\n\n[UI5 Tooling: Custom Server Middleware](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/v3/pages/extensibility/CustomServerMiddleware/)\n\n",
