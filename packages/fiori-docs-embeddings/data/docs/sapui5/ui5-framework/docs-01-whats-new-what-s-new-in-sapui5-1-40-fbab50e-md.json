The Belize theme replaces Blue Crystal \\(`sap_bluecrystal`\\) as the default theme. Blue Crystal is only supported until version 1.38.\n\n> ### Caution:  \n> The Belize theme does not support deprecated libraries such as `sap.ui.commons`, `sap.makit`, or `sap.ui.ux3` \\(see [Deprecated Themes and Libraries](../02_Read-Me-First/deprecated-themes-and-libraries-a87ca84.md)\\).\n> \n> Custom themes based on `sap_bluecrystal` are no longer supported with 1.40 or higher. Furthermore, custom themes cannot be converted to Belize automatically, you will have to adapt them manually.\n> \n> Belize does not support the same set of theme parameters as Blue Crystal. If you use custom themes or custom controls, check whether all parameters you use are still supported.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Sorry! Many of the examples, tutorials, and screenshots in this documentation still use Blue Crystal \\(`sap_bluecrystal`\\). Since there are so many, we simply could not manage to update those. Please keep in mind that you should use Belize \\(`sap_belize`\\) instead.\n\n<sub>New•Announcement•Info Only•1.40</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2016-08-24\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.40 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nDeleted \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nAnnouncement \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Older jQuery Versions Removed** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Older jQuery Versions Removed**\n\nAs of this version, SAPUI5 only contains one version of jQuery \\(the current version is 2.2.3\\). This standard version is always used when no other jQuery version is included in the bootstrap of an app. If you need a specific jQuery version for your app, add and load it explicitly as described in [noJQuery Variant for Bootstrapping](../04_Essentials/nojquery-variant-for-bootstrapping-91f1dd0.md).

To make sure that the cache always contains the latest view data, invalidate the cache whenever the data that is needed for preprocessing changes. When the cache is invalidated, all resources are processed again and the cache gets filled with new data. For more information, see [XML View Cache](../04_Essentials/xml-view-cache-3d85d5e.md).\n\nParts of this feature are currently still experimental! For more information, see [API Reference: `sap.ui.xmlview`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui/methods/sap.ui.xmlview).\n\n<sub>New•Feature•Info Only•1.40</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2016-08-24\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.40 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nNew \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Visual Interaction toolkit \\(`sap.ui.vk` library\\)** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Visual Interaction toolkit \\(`sap.ui.vk` library\\)**\n\nNew controls for the **Visual Interaction toolkit \\(`sap.ui.vk` library\\)**:\n\n-   Redlining controls: A number of controls have been added to the `sap.ui.vk.library` which allow you to create and edit basic redlining in 2D images or 3D models. These controls are:\n\n    -   `sap.ui.vk.RedlineDesign`\n\n    -   `sap.ui.vk.RedlineElement`\n\n    -   `sap.ui.vk.RedlineElementEllipse`\n\n    -   `sap.ui.vk.RedlineElementFreehand`\n\n    -   `sap.ui.vk.RedlineElementRectangle`\n\n    -   `sap.ui.vk.RedlineSurface`\n\n\n\nFor more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.vk).\n\n-   `sap.ui.vk.DecryptionHandler`: This control handles the decryption of encrypted models using third-party decryption algorithms.

Double check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing although you might expect these parts as given. While we aimed at being compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \\(like tree binding\\). The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).\n\nFor more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.40</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2016-08-24\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.40 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.GenericTile`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.GenericTile`**\n\nThe `GenericTile` control can be implemented as slide tile.

For example, you may wish to disable deletion for a sales order that has already been paid.\n\n    -   **Improved error and message handling**: Various 5xx / 4xx HTTP error codes related to system unavailability, authorization, and authentication are now handled in the list report. Meaningful and appropriate error messages are displayed, enhancing the usability of the application.\n\n    -   **Dynamic page**: The dynamic page with snapping header and floating tool bar is now available for the list report.\n\n\n-   **Object Page View**\n\n    -   **Hide the edit and delete actions**: You can now display or hide the edit action and delete action on the object page based on certain conditions that are specified in your back-end system. For example, you may wish to hide the *Edit* button for a sales order that has already been paid.\n\n    -   **Micro chart**: You can now add micro charts to a facet within the header area in the object page. Currently, the object page template supports bullet and area micro charts.\n\n    -   **Progress and rating indicator**: You can now add progress and rating indicators to a header facet on the object page.\n\n\n\n**Overview Page**\n\nOverview pages have been enhanced with the following features:\n\n-   **View switch in analytic cards**: Multiple individual cards can now be combined and displayed within a single card via the view switch feature. The switch is enabled from a dropdown menu below the header area.\n\n-   **Semantic coloring based on threshold values**: With this feature, column chart cards can be colored semantically based on threshold values. The threshold values come from data point annotation that is associated with the measure used in the analytic card.\n\n-   You can now create the following cards:\n\n\n    <table>\n    <tr>\n    <th valign=\"top\">\n\n    Time Series Chart Card\n    \n    </th>\n    <th valign=\"top\">\n\n    Combination Chart Card\n    \n    </th>\n    <th valign=\"top\">\n\n    Scatter Chart Card\n    \n    </th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n    \n    You can now create charts that use time as an axis category.\n    \n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n    \n    With a combination chart card, you can display more than one measure; the first measure gets displayed in a column format and the subsequent measure is displayed as lines within the chart.\n    \n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n    \n    With a scatter chart card, you can visualize the distribution of data points over two measures.\n    \n    </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n    \n    ![](images/Whats_New_140_OVP_Time_Series_1a9d333.png)\n    \n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n    \n    ![](images/Whats_New_140_OVP_Combination_Chart_55139a9.png)\n    \n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n    \n    ![](images/Whats_New_140_OVP_Scatter_Chart_f264ec1.png)\n    \n    </td>\n    </tr>\n    </table>\n    \n-   **Configuration chart navigation mode**: You can now configure the chart mode so that by clicking on a data point in the chart area of an analytic card you can see the name and value of the selected dimension.\n\n-   **Chart title**: Use the annotation term `UI.Chart` to display a chart title within the chart area of an analytic card.\n\n\n<sub>Changed•SAP Fiori Elements•Info Only•1.40</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2016-08-24\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.40 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nAnalysis Path Framework \\(APF\\) \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Analysis Path Framework \\(APF\\)** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Analysis Path Framework \\(APF\\)**\n\n**APF for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition \\(New\\)**\n\nThe APF Configuration Modeler app, as well as the generic APF runtime app, are now also available for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. This includes transporting APF content using the Adaptation Transport Organizer \\(ATO\\).\n\n**SAP Smart Business Design Time Integration in SAP S/4HANA \\(New\\)**\n\nIn SAP S/4HANA, APF is now available as a drill-down option in the SAP Smart Business KPI tile configuration. This helps to conveniently configure a KPI tile for an APF-based app. For more information, see [Configuring the SAP Smart Business KPI Tile](../07_APF/configuring-the-sap-smart-business-kpi-tile-374364e.md).\n\n**Default Values in Filter Configuration \\(Changed\\)**\n\nWhen you configure a filter, you can now specify that no values are selected by default at runtime. This option can improve the performance for filters that are optional, have a lot of values, and support multiple selections.
