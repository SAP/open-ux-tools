The annotations can be addressed either absolute or relative to a data path.\n\nThe consumption of label and description within an application is an example for a possible integration. Instead of copying the corresponding label text to a properties file, which in turn will be translated, a developer can bind a label against the label metadata field for the respective input field. This implies that annotations from metadata can also be language-dependent and would have to be translated as well.\n\nLet the following annotation be provided in the service metadata or an additionally loaded metadata file, such as **annotations0.xml** :\n\n```xml\n<Property Name=\"CompanyName\" Type=\"Edm.String\" MaxLength=\"80\" sap:label=\"Company Name\"/>\n```\n\nThe binding must then know the metadata part of the binding expression. The path to metadata therefore has to start with `/#`.\n\n-   Absolute Binding\n\n    An absolute binding path starts with the EntityType followed by the property name. Annotations can be accessed with `@` + **annotation**, while nodes can be accessed with the node name only.\n\n    For the example given above:\n\n    ```js\n    \n    var myLabel = new sap.m.Label({text:\"{/#Company/CompanyName/@sap:label}\"});\n    ```\n\n    To use the absolute binding for a property that doesn't occur in an EntityType of the default model, the reference to the correct model defined in the manifest can be added as a prefix. If you're not adding the model, the framework will tell you in the development console that the mentioned Entity is not present. Defining the target model can be done by adding `myModel>` in the beginning of the binding string.\n\n    Example:\n\n    ```js\n    \n    var myLabel = new sap.m.Label({text:\"{myModel>/#Company/CompanyName/@sap:label}\"});\n    ```\n\n-   Relative Binding\n\n    A relative binding path can be resolved relative to a data path/context.\n\n    Example:\n\n    ```js\n    \n    var myLabel = new sap.m.Label({text:\"{/Companies(1)/CompanyCode/#@sap:label}\"});\n    var myLabel2 = new sap.m.Label({text:\"{City/#@sap:label}\"});\n    myLabel2.bindElement(\"/Companies(1)\");\n    ```\n\n\n",
