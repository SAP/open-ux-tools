It helps developers catch errors early through type checking and by providing code assist in supporting code editors, for example through code completion and inline documentation.\n\nThe types can be seen as a complementary addition to improve your development experience and help you write applications in modern JavaScript. You may always remove them from your app again in case of any issues. Browsers can't execute TypeScript directly; it needs to be transpiled to JavaScript, which can then be executed as usual.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loioa7ee9617bc794b6fad21e4df38e31128__section_wg2_31v_4xb\"/>\n\n## Delivery of the SAPUI5 Type Information\n\nWhen writing TypeScript code, the type information can be scattered across the code. But you can also create separate type definition files for existing JavaScript libraries. For SAPUI5, we provide separate definition files that describe the SAPUI5 APIs and types. With the help of these definitions, you can write SAPUI5 apps in TypeScript and enjoy all the benefits that come with it.\n\nSAPUI5 type definitions are provided via npm under the name `@sapui5/types`\\(published directly by the SAPUI5 development team\\) and `@types/openui5` \\(maintained in the DefinitelyTyped infrastructure\\).\n\nProviding the type definitions as a separate package allows you to retain an older version of the types while upgrading the SAPUI5 runtime, which is one of the options to mitigate incompatible changes of the types. For more information, see our [compatibility statement](typescript-support-a7ee961.md#loioa7ee9617bc794b6fad21e4df38e31128__section_CSTD).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loioa7ee9617bc794b6fad21e4df38e31128__section_CSTD\"/>\n\n## Compatibility Statement for the SAPUI5 Type Definitions\n\nWe encourage you to use SAPUI5 with TypeScript for an improved development efficiency and experience. TypeScript itself keeps evolving, and we try to further improve the SAPUI5 type definitions, so there could be potential incompatible changes between versions of the type definitions. However, such incompatibilities would only affect the **compilation** of your code but will not cause **runtime** issues in your application. Plus, there are various ways to easily deal with them: You can, for example, simply keep using the previous version of the type definitions together with an updated SAPUI5 runtime. For more information, see *Breaking changes* below.\n\nKnown incompatibilities will be communicated in the [SAPUI5-TypeScript release notes](https://sap.github.io/ui5-typescript/releasenotes.html), and in the [What's New in SAPUI5](../01_Whats-New/what-s-new-in-sapui5-99ac68a.md).\n\n\n\n### Breaking changes\n\nSAPUI5 with TypeScript is in its final stage of stability, so please go ahead and use it! However, breaking changes can still occur. Possible reasons are:\n\n-   Fixes in the API documentation that cause TypeScript compiler errors,\n-   Changes in TypeScript itself,\n-   A significant improvement of a type definition that can only be achieved with a breaking change,\n-   A bug.\n\nFor more information, see [here](https://sap.github.io/ui5-typescript/beta-statement.html#why-will-there-still-be-breaking-changes-even-after-the-type-definitions-have-left-beta-stage).\n\nTo mitigate breaking changes, you have several options; some of them are listed here: [How to mitigate breaking changes?](https://sap.github.io/ui5-typescript/beta-statement.html#how-to-mitigate-breaking-changes-within-as-well-as-after-beta-phase)\n\n\n\n### Combining TypeScript versions and type definition releases\n\nSee [What is the plan regarding different TypeScript versions? Which ones will each type definition release be compatible with?](https://sap.github.io/ui5-typescript/beta-statement.html#what-is-the-plan-regarding-different-typescript-versions-which-ones-will-each-type-definition-release-be-compatible-with)\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loioa7ee9617bc794b6fad21e4df38e31128__section_pf4_34z_jyb\"/>\n\n## Further Information\n\n-   Documentation and resources: [SAPUI5 & TypeScript](https://sap.github.io/ui5-typescript/)\n-   Tutorial: [Learn App Development in SAPUI5 and TypeScript](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-tutorial)\n-   Check our [TypeScript To-Do List](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.sample.TsTodos/sample/sap.m.sample.TsTodos.webapp) demo application, which shows a sample TypeScript setup for developing SAPUI5 applications. You can also [Run the Unit Tests](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/sample/TsTodos/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.html).\n-   For SAPUI5 control development in TypeScript, see [TypeScript Guidelines](../09_Developing_Controls/typescript-guidelines-192397d.md)\n\nnpm Packages \\(check the individual packages for licensing information\\):\n\n-   [SAPUI5 type signatures on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sapui5/types)\n-   [OpenUI5 type signatures on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openui5/types)\n\n",
