We will use the `GenericTile` control in different scenarios, the `NumericContent`, and several micro charts. The `ProcessFlow` will be used in a further view to display detailed data in the production process. We will create micro charts that show more specific information as in the `ProcessFlow`. In another view, the `ChartContainer` will be used to display the test results of the newly built ice cream machine. Finally, we will create an additional view with a `Timeline` control that will display our customer reviews.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loioe5b7f8a93e4b432198869b3ae75981b0__section_jtg_1sp_f1b\"/>\n\n## Preview\n\n![](images/Start_page_a40b513.png)\n\n",
