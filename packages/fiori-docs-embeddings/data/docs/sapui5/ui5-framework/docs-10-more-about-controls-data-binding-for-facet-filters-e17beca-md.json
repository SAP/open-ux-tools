Fortunately, selections are maintained internally on the client by the `FacetFilterList` until the list is destroyed.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Facet Filter Selection](facet-filter-selection-ef860fc.md \"The FacetFilterList.getSelectedItems() method returns a copy of each selected facet filter item. You use the method to get the selected filter items when filtering the target data set. Therefore, you should not attempt to modify any of the item's properties.\")\n\n",
