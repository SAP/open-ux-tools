This layout has predefined layout types and defined routing between them that enables smooth navigation between the list-detail and list-detail-detail patterns of the app.\n\n-   A list page based on the `sap.f.DynamicPage` control that lists the available products and has filtering and sorting options.\n\n-   A detail page based on the `sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout` control containing detailed information about the selected object from the list page:\n\n    -   It implements the dynamic header of the `ObjectPageLayout` control.\n\n    -   The `sap.f.Avatar` control is used in the title area to display an image of the selected product.\n\n    -   The header title area can be collapsed \\(snapped to the title\\) by scrolling down the content of the page or by clicking/tapping the title area. The header area can also be pinned so that it remains visible when the user scrolls down the content of the page.\n\n    -   The title area has a set of actions on the right. The title area can display specific content when the header is snapped.\n\n    -   The floating footer is positioned at the bottom of the page, on top of the page content. It holds finalizing actions on the right.\n\n\n-   A detail-detail page based on `sap.f.DynamicPage` to display further details of the selected object from the detail page.\n\n-   A simple about page based on `sap.f.DynamicPage` to display further details of the selected object from the detail-detail page.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loioc4de2df385174e58a689d9847c7553bd__section_d2n_dmw_mbb\"/>\n\n## Preview\n\n  \n  \n**list-detail-detail pattern with sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout, sap.f.DynamicPage and sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout**\n\n![](images/With_Semantic_Helper_Fiori_2_0_Tutorial_fd98e0d.gif \"list-detail-detail pattern with sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout, sap.f.DynamicPage and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout\")\n\n\n\n> ### Tip:  \n> You don't have to do all tutorial steps sequentially, you can also jump directly to any step you want. Just download the code from the previous step, and start there.\n> \n> You can view and download the files for all steps in the Demo Kit at [Flexible Column Layout App](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.tutorial.fcl). Copy the code to your workspace and make sure that the application runs by calling the `webapp/index.html` file. Depending on your development environment you might have to adjust resource paths and configuration entries.\n> \n> For more information check the [Downloading Code for a Tutorial Step](get-started-setup-tutorials-and-demo-apps-8b49fc1.md#loio8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218__tutorials_download) section of the tutorials overview page [Get Started: Setup, Tutorials, and Demo Apps](get-started-setup-tutorials-and-demo-apps-8b49fc1.md).\n\n",
