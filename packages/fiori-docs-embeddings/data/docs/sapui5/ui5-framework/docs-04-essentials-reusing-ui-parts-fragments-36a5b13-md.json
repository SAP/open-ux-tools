They either have to be created as new controls, or they have to be created as views. Creating them as new controls results in a development overhead, while creating them as separate views results in a runtime overhead. In the latter case they would have a separate controller instead of having the same controller as the view does. Also, views and popup controls like dialogs do not go well together. The dialog content can be defined as a view but the dialog control itself always has to be written in the program.\n\nTo solve these issues, fragments have been introduced. They can be reused and, if source code is required and for event handler methods, they can connect to existing controllers of the \"owning\" view. This means that one important characteristic of fragments is that they are independent of the model-view-controller \\(MVC\\) concept and can be used without using MVC. However, if fragments are used together with views and controllers, fragments can make use of them and integrate them neatly.\n\nSimilar to `DocumentFragments` in HTML, the fragment itself has no HTML representation when it is inserted into the UI tree. Instead, its content is inserted. This means that fragments are not like controls, but more like a factory creating the contained controls. They support reuse and view modularization without adding overhead.\n\nSAPUI5 provides different types of fragments:\n\n-   XML fragments\n-   JS fragments\n-   HTML fragments \\(deprecated\\)\n\nMore fragment types can be implemented and plugged in.\n\nDefining a fragment is similar to defining views within a separate file. The fragments simply end with `*.fragment` instead of `*.view`. Also, the same rules for file location apply.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Model View Controller \\(MVC\\)](model-view-controller-mvc-91f2334.md \"The Model View Controller (MVC) concept is used in SAPUI5 to separate the representation of information from the user interaction.
