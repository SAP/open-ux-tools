Reason: There was a risk that dates are visualized by one day off. This wrong date might have been persisted to the back end.\n\nThis feature was introduced with UI5 1.102.0. The following UI5 versions still contain this feature:\n\n-   1.102.0 to 1.102.5\n-   1.103\n-   1.104\n\nIf you are on one of these releases, we recommend that you upgrade to a higher version where this feature is deactivated.\n\nDeactivated as of:\n\n-   1.106\n\n-   1.105\n\n-   1.102.6\n\n\nWe plan to bring this feature back in a different form at a later point in time.\n\n<sub>Changed•Announcement•Info Only•1.102</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-05-19\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.102 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n****`sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable`****\n\n-   We have provided a feature to export PDF documents based on the `com.sap.vocabularies.PDF.v1.Features` SAP Gateway annotation and the related `UI5ClientPDF` export type of the `exportType` property as the new default value.

The time zone can either be passed via configuration or specified via an annotation from a back-end service.\n\nThe following SAPUI5 functionality supports IANA time zones:\n\n-   Configuration of the default time zone via:\n\n    -   The `timezone` configuration option \\(see [`sap.ui.core.Configuration`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration)\\).\n\n    -   The API method [`sap.ui.core.Configuration.setTimezone`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration/methods/setTimezone)\n\n-   The time zone-specific `DateFormat` [`DateTimeWithTimezone`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat.DateTimeWithTimezone), which can be retrieved via [`sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat.getDateTimeWithTimezoneInstance`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/api/sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat%23methods/sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat.getDateTimeWithTimezoneInstance). It allows the formatting/parsing of timestamps while visualizing the date and/or the time and/or the time zone. For more information, see [Date Format](../04_Essentials/date-format-91f2eba.md) and [API Reference: `sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat).\n-   The new [`sap.ui.model.odata.type.DateTimeWithTimezone`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.type.DateTimeWithTimezone) composite type where the first part is the time stamp and the second part is the IANA time zone.\n-   The OData V4 model supports specifying the time zone via the `com.sap.vocabularies.common.v1.Timezone` annotation. For more information, see:\n\n    -   [Meta Model for OData V4](../04_Essentials/meta-model-for-odata-v4-7f29fb3.md)\n\n    -   [AnnotationHelper](../04_Essentials/meta-model-for-odata-v4-7f29fb3.md#loio7f29fb3ce5964d8090038a9d3cdf5060__section_AnnoHelp)\n\n    In OData V2, this is handled by the enhancements mentioned for `sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField` and `sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable` below.\n\n-   [`sap.m.DateTimePicker`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.DateTimePicker) visualizes the time zone based on the type information. In addition, it has its own properties for visualizing the time zone.\n-   [`sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField) supports time zones for `Edm.DateTimeOffset` fields with the `com.sap.vocabularies.common.v1.Timezone` annotation.\n-   [`sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable) supports time zones for `Edm.DateTimeOffset` properties with the `com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.TimeZone` annotation. For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smarttable).\n-   Spreadsheet export now supports the additional `timezone` property. For more information, see [Data Types for Spreadsheet Export](../04_Essentials/data-types-for-spreadsheet-export-283217d.md).\n-   SAP Fiori elements: The time zone can be specified for `Edm.DateTimeOffset` fields.

For example, if `sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView`'s `content` aggregation is marked as default, you can define content for the aggregation directly in the XML view, without explicitly adding a `content` tag. Of course, when a container control does not have a default aggregation defined, or when adding a child control into another aggregation, you still need to use an aggregation tag, for example `dependents`.\n\nIn order to align the usage of XML views and controls even further, aggregations such as `content` and `dependents` are now also bindable. This is only supported when following the best practice not to use native HTML inside XML views. For more information, see [Aggregation Handling in XML Views](../04_Essentials/aggregation-handling-in-xml-views-19eabf5.md).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.102</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-05-19\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.102 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V2 Model** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V2 Model**\n\nThe `sap.ui.model.odata.OperationMode.Auto` operation mode is deprecated.
