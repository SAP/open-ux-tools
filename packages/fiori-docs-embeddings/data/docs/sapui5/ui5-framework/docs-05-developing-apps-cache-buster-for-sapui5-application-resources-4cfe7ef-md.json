Then the recalculation and caching of meta data for SAPUI5 apps potentially needed after any system and language import for an SAPUI5 app are done automatically in the background.\n\n-   Under typical conditions, for example when using SAPUI5 apps or when developing with the SAPUI5 repository team provider or the SAPUI5 repository upload and download reports, the application cache buster and the cache buster of the SAPUI5 core work fully automatically.\n\n-   You can trigger a refresh of the cache buster and application meta data for a specific SAPUI5 repository \\(and the application or component inside\\) manually by calling the URL `<URL to SAPUI5 application or component>/do-update-meta-data` in the browser. See SAP Note 2187043.\n\n-   In addition to cache busting on the level of a single application resource mentioned above, the cache buster for SAPUI5 application resources supports also cache busting on the level of multiple and all application resources.\n\n-   The cache buster technology is used by SAP Fiori launchpad, and SAP Fiori and High Performance Analytic \\(HPA\\) apps.\n\n-   Fore more information, see SAP Notes 2075016 and 2085648.\n\n",
