Note that this is only relevant in non-draft scenarios and therefore applicable only to SAP Fiori elements for OData V2.\n\n-   Displaying custom messages to the user, as described in [Adding Custom Messages](adding-custom-messages-5a9a2a0.md)\n\n-   Changing the title of the message popup after a quick action has been performed by the system in SAP Fiori elements for OData V2. For examples, see [Adding Custom Messages](adding-custom-messages-5a9a2a0.md).\n\n-   Custom code that changes the state of the object. When using SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, set `updatesDocument` to `true`.\n\n\nThe function that is to be executed must be encapsulated in a `fnFunction` function. In most use cases, the operation performed by this method is executed asynchronously. Therefore, `fnFunction` is to return a `Promise` that indicates that the operation has finished.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> `fnFunction` must not perform any user interactions.\n\nDepending on the state of the user interaction, `fnFunction` may or may not be executed. For example, `fnFunction` is not executed if the following conditions apply:\n\n-   In non-draft scenarios. Note that this is only applicable to SAP Fiori elements for OData V2.\n\n-   If the user is in edit mode\n\n-   If the user has entered data but hasn't saved yet\n\n-   If the user has triggered an action that is implemented via `securedExecution`\n\n-   If the user has clicked *Cancel* in the dataloss conformation dialog\n\n\nNote that the `securedExecution` method also returns a `Promise`. This `Promise` is rejected if `fnFunction` is not executed for any reason. If `fnFunction` is executed, the `Promise` returned by `securedExecution` behaves like the `Promise` returned by `fnFunction`.\n\nFor more information for SAP Fiori elements for OData V2, see the *API Reference* for [`securedExecution`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ListReport.extensionAPI.ExtensionAPI/methods/securedExecution).\n\nFor more information for SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.fe.core.controllerextensions.EditFlow/methods/securedExecution) in the Demo Kit. \n\n",
