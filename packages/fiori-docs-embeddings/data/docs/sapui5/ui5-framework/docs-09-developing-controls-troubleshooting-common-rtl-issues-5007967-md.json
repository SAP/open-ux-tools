This is not explicitly written in the CSS and is therefore not mirrored.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSpecify the background position explicitly to display the RTL version correctly.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nText is incorrectly aligned because the CSS `text-align` property is not converted.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nDo not use `text-align:left` if you want the text to change sides in RTL mode, but use `text-align:start` instead. `start` and `end` are handled automatically by the browser. Only use `right` and `left` if you want the text to stay on the same side in RTL mode.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nIf style is set using JavaScript \\(for example, in the renderer or behavior of a control\\), the conversion does not take place and the result looks incorrect.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nConsider the RTL mode in your calculations, or when possible, use the CSS file instead \\(which is automatically handled\\) and write a CSS class.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nThe alignment of popups with the parent element is unaffected by RTL mode and is therefore often incorrect.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`sap.ui.core.Popup.Dock` has been extended by adding `Begin*` and\"`End*`. Those will change sides in RTL mode. Use these instead of `Left*` and `Right*` if the popup alignment should change sides.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nWhen JavaScript calculations are used to determine positions or dimensions, existing implementations might imply LTR mode and result in an incorrect layout.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nMake these algorithms RTL-compliant by checking the SAPUI5 RTL configuration.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nSome text elements inside the control may look incorrect, for instance parentheses may be shown in the wrong position, pointing to the wrong direction. For example **\\(very\\) short text** might be rendered as **very\\) short text\\)** in RTL mode.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nThis is a result of the browser's `bidi` algorithm considering the directionality of the characters used. As soon as there is LTR text in the control, the parentheses will be fine again. For controls that have mixed contents, see [API Properties for Right-to-Left Support in Text-Displaying Controls](../05_Developing_Apps/api-properties-for-right-to-left-support-in-text-displaying-controls-7e7cd0a.md) \n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nWhen a control has a `textAlign` property \\(or something similar\\), you need to use additional API properties to ensure the correct alignment of the text according to the directionality.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nUse the [API Properties for Right-to-Left Support in Text-Displaying Controls](../05_Developing_Apps/api-properties-for-right-to-left-support-in-text-displaying-controls-7e7cd0a.md) .\n\nAdditionally, the static helper method `sap.ui.core.Renderer.getTextAlign(oTextAlign, oTextDirection)` is available. This method calculates the effective value of the CSS `text-align` property considering the property setting and the current or given RTL mode.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n",
