To reduce the file size, these ZIP containers can be compressed.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nHeader row\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nThe exported spreadsheet contains a header row with the corresponding column labels.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\nAlso, the exported spreadsheet uses the built-in auto filter for all configured columns. This will allow the user to apply filters directly in the exported file without having to change the file.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nLocalization\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nThe location of the user exporting a file is taken into account, and the content of the exported spreadsheet will contain translated column headers and the required date, time, and Boolean representation.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Partially supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Yellow_Led_3ea53dc.gif)\n\nColumn headers in the exported file can be shown in the user's language as defined in the back-end system and might differ from what the user sees on the UI.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\nThe column headers in the exported file are the same as the ones shown on the UI.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nMeta information\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nMetadata with additional information is shown in the exported spreadsheet.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\nProvides an appendix to add information to the data sheet.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\nProvides an optional sheet in the workbook to attach additional information to the exported spreadsheet. This meta information is grouped and thus allows you to add information in different layers without any conflicts. A typical use case would be that, for example, `SmartTable` adds some basic information, and an application developer could enhance this by adding something on top of it.\n\nIn addition to that, the client export allows you to add additional information that is not part of the sheets inside the workbook. This data is built-in information and can be processed by applications like Microsoft Excel.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nHierarchies\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nThe exported file can contain hierarchies that are visualized when opening the file with Microsoft Excel.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nData types\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nOffice Open XML spreadsheets support various types of data that have a different visual and functional behavior.

In addition to the mere support for these data types, it is possible to pass additional configuration to create formatted text aggregations, a particular date and time output format, textual Boolean representation \\(for example, *in stock/out of stock* instead of `true`/`false`\\), and units of measurement.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nRead Access Logging \\(RAL\\) support\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nIf configured, Read Access Logging tracks who has access to which data at which point in time.This information might be required for audits.\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n![Supported](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n![](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Green_Led_3cb17ee.gif) = Supported, ![](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Yellow_Led_3ea53dc.gif) = Partially supported, ![](../02_Read-Me-First/images/Red_Led_5befb5a.gif) = Not supported\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[API Reference: `SmartTable`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smarttable.SmartTable/controlProperties)\n\n",
