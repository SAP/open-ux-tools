Popups, message boxes, and busy dialogs interrupt the user and require some additional interaction. Message toast and message strip are used to just display some status information without interrupting the user. Interrupting dialogs have a more complex structure, but all generally follow the same structure - a title, content area and some actions. The title should be the first thing read by the screen reader. It should explain the general purpose of the dialog \\(i.e. Data confirmation, Interruption\\). If the dialog contains initially focused elements, like action buttons, those should be read after the title announcement. The contents of the dialog should be read in their respective order.\n\n\n\n## Titles and Labels\n\nThe behavior of controls based on Dialog/Popup \\(`role=\"dialog\"`\\) changes depending on their `aria-labelledby` attribute.\n\nIf the control has an `aria-labelledby` attribute, the screen reader will announce the following elements:\n\n-   The provided label\n\n-   The role of the dialog\n\n-   The currently focused element\n\n\nIf the control does NOT have an `aria-labelledby` attribute, the screen reader will announce the following elements:\n\n-   All elements in the dialog \\(regardless if interactive or not\\)\n\n-   The role of the dialog\n\n-   The currently focused element\n\n\nThe `title` property of a Popover/Dialog is used to display the title of the dialog. If the dialog has no visible title, but one is needed, it can be provided as a reference to another control in `ariaLabelledBy` association. All other text that needs to be read before the title, can be added there as well.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> A dialog without a title will be read completely when it appears. Users with screen readers will not be able to differentiate it from the rest of the application.\n\n> ### Example:  \n> Dialog with `ariaLabelledBy` \n> \n> ```\n> // Dialog required from \"sap/m/Dialog\"\n> // Button required from \"sap/m/Button\"\n> // Text required from \"sap/m/Text\"\n> \n> var oDialog = new Dialog({\n>     title: \"Dialog Title\",\n>     ariaLabelledBy: \"textId\",\n>     content: [\n>         new Text({\n>             id: \"textId\",\n>             text: \"A sample text that will be annoucned by JAWS after the title, when the dialog is opened.\"\n>         })\n>     ]\n> });\n> \n> var btn = new Button({\n>     text:\"Hello World\",\n>     press: function() {\n>         oDialog.open();\n>     }\n> });\n> ```\n\n",
