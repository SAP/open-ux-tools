The license and maintenance conditions of the respective platforms also apply for SAPUI5. If you use SAPUI5 tools on SAP Business Technology Platform, for example, the license and maintenance conditions of the SAP BTP apply.\n\nDepending on your use case, the following environments might be interesting for you:\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio7bb04e05f9484e1b95b38a2e48ecef4f__section_ud3_1ds_ymb\"/>\n\n## UI5 Tooling\n\n[UI5 Tooling](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/) is an open and modular toolchain to develop state-of-the-art SAPUI5 applications. As a modern build and development environment it comes with a [command line interface \\(CLI\\)](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/CLI/), leverages Node.js and npm, and is being further advanced as an open-source project.\n\nFollow these steps to start your UI5 journey with UI5 Tooling:\n\n1.  Install the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)\n\n2.  Open a new terminal and execute `npm i -g @ui5/cli`\n\nYou're all set! Start your journey by checking out the [UI5 sample app](https://github.com/SAP/openui5-sample-app) or our [Walkthrough Tutorial \\(JavaScript\\)](../03_Get-Started/walkthrough-tutorial-javascript-3da5f4b.md).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio7bb04e05f9484e1b95b38a2e48ecef4f__section_gvr_kmy_ymb\"/>\n\n## SAP Business Application Studio\n\nSAP Business Application Studio is an SAP BTP service in the Cloud Foundry environment which offers a modular development environment tailored for efficient development of business applications. It provides a tailor-made development environment for various development scenarios. With each of these scenarios you can create different types of applications, including SAPUI5 apps.\n\nSee [App Development Using SAP Business Application Studio](app-development-using-sap-business-application-studio-6bbad66.md) for more information.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio7bb04e05f9484e1b95b38a2e48ecef4f__section_lwm_nmy_ymb\"/>\n\n## Other Environments\n\nIn general, you can use the JavaScript IDE of your choice. Some use cases as well as some former development environments are described in [Other Environments](other-environments-f0898e6.md).\n\n",
