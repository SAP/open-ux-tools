We strongly recommend that you follow these guidelines even if you find them violated somewhere. For files that are consistently **not** following these rules and for which adhering to the rules would make the code worse, follow the local style. If you want to contribute your content to SAPUI5, you **have to** follow these conventions and guidelines.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> This list is not complete.\n\n\n\n## General Guidelines\n\nThe following list gives some general guidelines to be adhered to when developing content for SAPUI5:\n\n-   Always consider the developers who **use** your control or code! Do not surprise them, but give them what they expect. And make it simple.\n\n-   Use tabs, not spaces, for indentation; adhere to local standards in the file.\n\n-   Use Unix line endings \\(LF-only\\).\n\n-   Text files must be UTF-8 encoded \\(HANA\\); only `*.properties` and `*.hdbtextbundle` files must be ISO8859-1 encoded as defined in the corresponding standard.\n\n    This is the status quo. As this causes issues, it may be subject to change..\n\n-   An 80-character line length guideline does **not** exist.\n\n-   Use comments; do **not** rephrase the code, but tell the reader what is **not** in the code. Describe why your code does what it does. Prefer line comments.\n\n\n",
