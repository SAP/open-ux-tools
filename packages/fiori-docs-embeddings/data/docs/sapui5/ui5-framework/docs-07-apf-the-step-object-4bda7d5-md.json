It is referenced in the `category` objects in which the step is displayed in the analysis step gallery.\n\nThe `step` object consists of a `request` object and a `binding` object. The `request` defines the access to the server resource, that is, it retrieves the data that is displayed on the UI. The `binding` maps the required representation types to the analysis step, which defines the way in which the data is displayed on the UI, for example, in a chart or a list.\n\nOn the UI, analysis steps are shown in the analysis step gallery as template objects. The step template object is derived from the `step` object in the configuration file, but contains only the information that is required on the UI, for example, the texts and the representations. When a user selects an analysis step from the gallery, a new step instance is created. An instance of a `step` object provides the representation type that is currently used both in the analysis step display as a chart or a list, and in the analysis path display as a thumbnail.\n\nOptionally, the step object can contain the filter mapping configuration. Filter mapping can be useful when a selection that can be made in one analysis step cannot be handled by a subsequent step. In this case, the system determines the source filter property based on the selections made in a chart and maps them to another filter that can be used in the requests for subsequent steps in the path \\(mapped filter property\\).\n\nThe step object has the following format:\n\n```\n\n{\n  \"type\" : \"step\",    // optional\n  \"id\" : \"<step ID>\",\n  \"title\" : <label>\n  \"longTitle\" : <label>    // optional\n  \"request\" : \"<request ID>\",\n  \"binding\" : \"<binding ID>\",\n  \"topNSettings\" : {    //optional\n      \"top\" : \"<number>\",\n      \"orderby\" : [{\n          \"property\" : \"<property name>\",\n          \"ascending\" : <boolean>\n      }*]\n  },\n  \"navigationTargets\" : [ {\"type\" : \"navigationTarget\" , \"id\" : \"<navigation target ID>\"}* ]\n  \"thumbnail\" : <thumbnail>,\n   \"filterMapping\" : {    // optional\n      \"requestForMappedFilter\" : \"<request ID>\",\n      \"target\" : [ <mapped filter properties>*],\n      \"keepSource\" : <boolean> \n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe properties used in the step object denote the following:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nProperty\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nDescription\n\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`id` \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nUnique ID of type string\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`title` \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nTitle displayed in the analysis step gallery and in the analysis path display.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n`longTitle` \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nTitle displayed above the representation in the analysis step display.

The lookup request maps the source filter properties to the mapped filter properties. The source filter properties are derived from the selections made in the current step.
