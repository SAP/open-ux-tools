The template implements a typical \"Worklist\" floorplan, one of the patterns that are specified by the SAP Fiori design guidelines, but you can also use it as a starting point for easily creating any kind of list-based apps. For more information about worklist floorplans, see the *Related Information* section at the bottom of this topic.\n\n\n\n## Preview\n\n  \n  \n**Start page of the app with list of products and actions**\n\n![](images/Tutorial_Worklist_Step_5_Preview_016d473.png \"Start page of the app with list of products and actions\")\n\n  \n  \n**Product detail page of the app**\n\n![](images/Tutorial_Worklist_Step_7_Preview_a517fe5.png \"Product detail page of the app\")\n\n\n\n> ### Tip:  \n> You don't have to do all tutorial steps sequentially, you can also jump directly to any step you want. Just download the code from the previous step, and start there.\n> \n> You can view and download the files for all steps in the Demo Kit at [Worklist App](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.tutorial.worklist). Copy the code to your workspace and make sure that the application runs by calling the `webapp/index.html` file. Depending on your development environment you might have to adjust resource paths and configuration entries.\n> \n> For more information check the [Downloading Code for a Tutorial Step](get-started-setup-tutorials-and-demo-apps-8b49fc1.md#loio8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218__tutorials_download) section of the tutorials overview page [Get Started: Setup, Tutorials, and Demo Apps](get-started-setup-tutorials-and-demo-apps-8b49fc1.md).\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[SAP Fiori design guidelines: Worklist Floorplans](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design/floorplans/work-list/)\n\n[Developing Apps with SAP Fiori Tools](../05_Developing_Apps/developing-apps-with-sap-fiori-tools-a460a73.md \"SAP Fiori tools is a set of extensions for SAP Business Application Studio and Visual Studio Code that makes it faster and easier to develop basic SAP Fiori apps.\")\n\n",
