To create a rule, you need to set the properties and add a check function.\n\nFor more information on how to create rules in the user interface, see [Rules Management](rules-management-3fc864a.md).\n\nYou can find best practices on how to create rules in [Guidelines and Best Practices](guidelines-and-best-practices-eaeea19.md) .\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loioc24569de859446819798c5dc53ac604d__section_uss_5gd_21b\"/>\n\n## Properties\n\nYou need to set the following properties :\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nProperty\n\n</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">\n\nDescription\n\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nID\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nThe ID of the rule.

The main ones are `oIssueManager`, `oCoreFacade` and `oScope`, and the optional one is `fnResolve`. Here is more information about them:\n\n-   `oIssueManager` - allows you to add new issues with the `addIssue()` method. The issue object has the following properties:\n\n    -   Severity - the possible values are:\n\n        -   `sap.ui.support.Severity.Low`\n\n        -   `sap.ui.support.Severity.Medium`\n\n        -   `sap.ui.support.Severity.High`\n\n\n    -   Details - free text, may include any type of details related to the issue.\n\n    -   Context - an object, which has an `ID` property. The `ID` should belong to the element, which generates the issue.\n\n\n-   `oCoreFacade` - gives you access to the different elements provided by the SAPUI5 core framework:\n\n    -   <code><a href=\"https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.support.CoreFacade%23methods/getMetadata\">getMetadata()</a></code>\n\n    -   <code><a href=\"https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.support.CoreFacade%23methods/getUIAreas\">getUIAreas()</a></code>\n\n    -   <code><a href=\"https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.support.CoreFacade%23methods/getComponents\">getComponents()</a></code>\n\n    -   <code><a href=\"https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.support.CoreFacade%23methods/getModels\">getModels()</a></code>\n\n\n-   `oScope` - retrieves elements in the scope with the following methods:\n\n    -   `getElements()` - returns all the elements.\n\n    -   `getElementsByClassName(className)` - the className can be, for example, `sap.m.Button`. The function returns all elements of type `sap.m.Button`.\n\n    -   `getPublicElements()` - returns all elements that are part of public API aggregations.\n\n    -   `getLoggedObjects(type)` - returns all logged objects. The method provides access to the logs and traces in the browser Console. Note that it is possible to enhance the log traces with an extra `fnSupportInfo` object which you can then analyze in the rule check function. The `fnSupportInfo` function is called only when support mode is turned on with the URL parameter `sap-ui-support` set to `true` \\(`sap-ui-support=true`\\). For more information, see [Rules for the Console Traces and Logging](common-rule-patterns-3fc1412.md#loio3fc141206cee4ab2aa514b569ed423c0__section_Rules_for_the_Console_Traces_and_Logging).\n\n\n    Prior to version 1.54, `getElements` was not accepting any arguments and was returning all elements registered with the core. Now it accepts one query object parameter. This allows you to select only a specific subset of elements valid for your use case. The three parameters of the method are `type`, `public`, and `cloned`.\n\n    Here is an example format:\n\n    ```\n    var queryObject = {\n    \n      type: \"sap.m.Button\", // String property specifying the type to select\n    \n      public: true, // Boolean property specifying whether only public elements should be loaded\n    \n      cloned: false // Boolean argument specifying if cloned elements are needed\n    \n    }\n    ```\n\n    When the `public` parameter is set to true, the `getElements` function only explores public aggregations. It is useful if, for example, you have a composite control comprising of public and internal subelements, and you only want to check the public ones.\n\n    The `cloned` parameter allows you to filter out elements that are clones of list bindings. If you don't want to explore issues associated with multiple cloned elements, for example repeated table cell content, set `cloned: false` and the results will include only one representative instance.\n\n    Here is an example of a check function that checks all Input controls which are part of the public aggregation and have no parent set:\n\n    ```js\n    \n    function(issueManager, oCoreFacade, oScope) {\n        var mElements = oScope.getElements({\n            type: \"sap.m.Input\",\n            public: true,\n            cloned: false\n        });\n    \n        for (var n in mElements) {\n            var oElement = mElements[n];\n    \n            if (!oElement.getParent()) {\n                issueManager.addIssue({\n                    severity: Severity.Medium, // Severity enum is taken from \"sap/ui/support/library\" import\n                    details: \"The element \" + oElement.getId() + \" has no parent.\",\n                    context: {\n                        id: oElement.getId()\n                    }\n                });\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    ```\n\n-   `fnResolve` - an optional parameter. It is passed to the check function only when the rule property `async` is set to `true` to allow you, as the rule developer, to resolve an asynchronous operation. The rule times out if it takes more than 10 seconds to resolve.\n\n    Here is an async rule code example:\n\n    ```js\n    function(issueManager, oCoreFacade, oScope, fnResolve) {\n      // Some async operation\n      setTimeout(function () {\n        â€¦\n        fnResolve();\n      }, 2000);\n    }\n    \n    ```\n\n\n> ### Remember:  \n> Make sure to call <code><b>issueManager.addIssue()</b></code> in your check function so that issues can be seen in the analysis results.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[API Reference: `sap.ui.support.ExecutionScope`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.support.ExecutionScope)\n\n[Common Rule Patterns](common-rule-patterns-3fc1412.md \"The Support Assistant checks verify different aspects of your web application - from the view/elements structure and control properties to the dynamic, data and event-driven interactions.
