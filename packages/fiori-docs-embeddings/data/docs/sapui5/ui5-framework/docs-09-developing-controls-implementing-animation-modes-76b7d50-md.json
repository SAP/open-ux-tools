There may be cases where the animation has to be suppressed, for example, for performance reasons or for specific users. As a control developer, you have to make sure that your control supports the animation modes that are offered to the users.\n\nThe following animation modes are available:\n\n-   `full`: all animations are shown\n\n-   `basic`: a reduced, more light-weight set of animations\n\n-   `minimal`: no animations are shown, except animations of fundamental functionality\n\n-   `none`: deactivates the animation completely\n\n\nThe animation mode can either be set using the configuration parameter `window['sap-ui-config]['animationMode']` or as URL parameter \\(see [Configuration Options and URL Parameters](../04_Essentials/configuration-options-and-url-parameters-91f2d03.md)\\).\n\nThe value for the attribute `data-sap-ui-animation-mode` on the `<html>` document root element is injected automatically on loading with the return value by using the `getAnimationMode` method of the configuration object.\n\nIf the mode is changed, the value of `data-sap-ui-animation-mode` is updated correspondingly.\n\nThe attribute can be selected in CSS with `html[data-sap-ui-animation-mode=\"<mode>\"]`.\n\n> ### Example:  \n> The following implementation defines the duration for animation mode `full` with 1 sec, `minimal` and `basic` with 0.1 sec, and `none` with 0.0 sec.\n> \n> ```\n> html[data-sap-ui-animation-mode=\"full\"] .someClassName{\n>     transition-duration: 1.0s;\n> }\n> html[data-sap-ui-animation-mode=\"minimal\"] .someClassName,\n> html[data-sap-ui-animation-mode=\"basic\"] .someClassName {\n>     transition-duration: 0.1s;\n> }\n> \n> html[data-sap-ui-animation-mode=\"none\"] .someClassName {\n>     transition-duration: 0.0s;\n> }\n> ```\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Configuration Options and URL Parameters](../04_Essentials/configuration-options-and-url-parameters-91f2d03.md \"The following tables show available configuration options.\")\n\n",
