Based on specific use cases, the feature allows applications to control the non-working hours on a granular level. With this new feature, applications can configure a weekly pattern specifying multiple time intervals per day that can be hidden. The time pattern supports hours, minutes, and seconds for each interval.\n\nThis feature is supported in stepwise zoom, proportional zoom, and the fullscreen strategies. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.gantt.skipTime.WeekPattern) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.gantt.simple.GanttChartWithTable/sample/sap.gantt.sample.GanttChart2HideNonWorkingHours).\n\nIn addition to the support for the weekly pattern, applications can extend the base discontinuity provider to define their own use cases for hiding specific parts of the Gantt timeline.

To add an icon, set an icon URI to either of the newly introduced `icon` or `endIcon` properties. These properties only accept icons, not images.

It enables developers to add multiple badges on one card. Additionally, the new API allows them to add icons, state color, announcement text, and to control the visibility of the badge with the visibility mode. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.cards.CardBadgeCustomData) and the [Badge Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/badge)..\n\n-   We have added a new `fallbackSrc` property available for images in Object cards. You can use it to set a fallback image source, in case the main `src` source fails to load.

This event helps app developers to save user preferences and use them later.
