This allows different views on the same data but also means that data is not automatically shared between bindings. There are mechanisms for sharing data to avoid redundant requests and to keep the same data in different controls in sync.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio648e360fa22d46248ca783dc6eb44531__section_relativeBindings\"/>\n\n## Relative Bindings\n\nAn OData V4 binding may or may not initiate own data requests. Data sharing between a parent binding and a dependent binding is possible if the dependent binding does not send its own data requests. Both bindings will then use the same data storage and may share data that is accessed by both bindings. To this end, the dependent binding has to be relative to a `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context`, and the dependent binding must not have any binding parameters. The only exception is the `$$noPatch` binding parameter of the OData V4 property binding.\n\nThe following example shows a typical list-detail scenario with a list of objects and the details of the selected object:\n\n```xml\n<mvc:View id=\"list\">\n    <Table items=\"{/SalesOrderList}\">\n        <ColumnListItem>\n            <Text text=\"{SalesOrderID}\"/>\n            <Text text=\"{SO_2_BP/CompanyName}\"/>\n            <Text text=\"{GrossAmount}\"/>\n            <Text text=\"{Currency}\"/>\n        </ColumnListItem>\n    </Table>\n</mvc:View>\n \n<mvc:View id=\"detail\">\n    <Text text=\"{SalesOrderID}\"/>\n    <Text text=\"{SO_2_BP/CompanyName}\"/>\n    <Text text=\"{NetAmount}\"/>       \n    <Text text=\"{Currency}\"/>\n    <Text text=\"{Note}\"/>\n</mvc:View>\n```\n\nAs we are using the model feature `autoExpandSelect`, we are getting a tailored `$select` clause in the `GET` request, and only the properties displayed in the table are read from the back end:\n\n`GET SalesOrderList?$select=Currency,GrossAmount,SalesOrderID&$expand=SO_2_BP($select=BusinessPartnerID,CompanyName)&$skip=0&$top=100`\n\nUpon selection of an object in the list, the row context is used as the binding context for the detail section. Note that this row context will always be a V4 context, `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context`. Setting the binding context resolves the property bindings of the detail section. Missing properties are requested with the following request. Note that properties already available are not requested again.\n\n`GET SalesOrderList('0500000001')?$select=NetAmount,Note`\n\nEditing any properties shown in the list or the detail section will automatically be reflected in the other place as well.\n\nThe OData V4 model can help you to get such a row context in the detail view controller, without knowledge about the list view. Mark the table's list binding in the list view with the `$$getKeepAliveContext` parameter; for more information see [`sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#bindList`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23methods/bindList). Then call [`sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#getKeepAliveContext`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23methods/getKeepAliveContext) with a binding path to the entity. This function always returns such a context that shares data with a binding having a matching collection path and `$$getKeepAliveContext` set. If such a list binding exists, it returns a context with that path. If necessary, it creates such a context and requests its entity using the given group ID. This context is set to **keep-alive** \\(see [Extending the Lifetime of a Context that is not Used Exclusively by a Table Collection](data-reuse-648e360.md#loio648e360fa22d46248ca783dc6eb44531__section_ELC) below\\). If no marked list binding exists, a temporary binding is used; as soon as a binding with `$$getKeepAliveContext` is created with or resolves to the matching collection path, the context and its data are moved to this binding and share the data with the list. The temporary binding is destroyed afterwards. See also [`sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#requestKeyPredicate`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/methods/requestKeyPredicate) in order to create proper URI-encoded key predicates within the binding path for the entity.\n\nYou do not have to take care whether the `$$getKeepAliveContext` binding currently exists; you can simply use the context as if the list was there. Even `replaceWith` works when given another context from `getKeepAliveContext` \\(for example when canceling a draft and replacing it with the active instance\\), and `ODataContextBinding#invoke` supports the `bReplaceWithRVC` parameter \\(for example to replace the active version with the draft after an *Edit* action\\). When the list later appears, both contexts - the active one and the replaced one - will be moved to it, and the data is merged when the list reads it from the back end.\n\nBe aware that the usage of a temporary binding has the consequence that the context may change the binding during its lifetime. So don't keep a reference to it, always take it from the context. Note also that these contexts are kept alive and you must call `setKeepAlive(false)` if you do not need them anymore.\n\nThe following example assumes that the binding path of the sales order is given via the routing, with \"key\" matching the key predicate of the order.\n\n**Sample list view**\n\n```xml\n<mvc:View id=\"list\">\n    <Table items=\"{\n        path: '/SalesOrderList', \n        parameters: {\n            $$getKeepAliveContext: true\n        }}\">\n        <ColumnListItem>\n            <Text text=\"{SalesOrderID}\"/>\n            <Text text=\"{SO_2_BP/CompanyName}\"/>\n            <Text text=\"{GrossAmount}\"/>\n            <Text text=\"{Currency}\"/>\n        </ColumnListItem>\n    </Table>\n</mvc:View>\n```\n\n**Detail view controller \\(extract\\)**\n\n```js\n\n...\nonPatternMatched : function (oEvent) {\n    var // Note: We assume that the key predicate is encoded correctly because it has been\n        // taken from an existing context when calling Router#navTo\n        sPath = \"/SalesOrderList\" + oEvent.getParameter(\"arguments\").key,\n        oView = this.getView();\n  \n    oView.setBindingContext(oView.getModel().getKeepAliveContext(sPath));\n...\n```\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n-   See also our [demo app](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.odata.v4.Draft).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio648e360fa22d46248ca783dc6eb44531__section_g5j_v1r_mgb\"/>\n\n## Return Values of Bound Actions\n\nThe data of the returned entity is synchronized into the binding parameter of the bound action if the following conditions apply:\n\n-   The conditions for a return value context as described for the `invoke` method of `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding` are fulfilled.\n\n    For more information, see the [API Reference: `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#invoke`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding%23methods/invoke). \n\n-   The returned entity has the same key predicate as the binding parameter.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio648e360fa22d46248ca783dc6eb44531__section_uz4_fzq_xlb\"/>\n\n## Shared Requests\n\nThe same data needs to be requested only once for use cases like value help controls where the following conditions apply:\n\n-   The same view on the same resource is used in different bindings.\n\n-   The data is immutable, i.e. it does not change on the server and is not changed on the client.\n\n\nFor this, you may use the `$$sharedRequest` binding parameter for all the list bindings that do not need to request the data individually.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> A binding becomes read-only by using the `$$sharedRequest` parameter.\n\n**Example:** Using the `$$sharedRequest` binding parameter:\n\n```xml\n\n...\n<Table items=\"{/SalesOrderList}\">\n    ...\n   <ColumnListItem>\n      <Select selectedKey=\"{BuyerID}\"\n            forceSelection=\"false\"\n            items=\"{path: '/BusinessPartnerList', templateShareable: false,\n               parameters : {$$sharedRequest:true}}\">\n         <items>\n            <core:ListItem key=\"{BusinessPartnerID}\" text=\"{CompanyName}\"/>\n         </items>\n      </Select>\n   </ColumnListItem>\n</Table>\n...\n```\n\nThe `$$sharedRequest` binding parameter is used automatically for list bindings of [value list](value-lists-ab267a6.md) models. Note that you can also set the `$$sharedRequest` parameter on the model, which means that all list bindings created within this model receive `$$sharedRequest=true` by default. For more information, see the [API Reference: `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#Constructor`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23constructor). \n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio648e360fa22d46248ca783dc6eb44531__section_ELC\"/>\n\n## Extending the Lifetime of a Context that is not Used Exclusively by a Table Collection\n\nIf, due to filtering or sorting of the list, the entity shown in the detail view is no longer part of the list, then the context pointing to this entity is destroyed. As a consequence, its data also vanishes inside the detail view. To prevent this drawback, `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#setKeepAlive` can be used. This method allows you to extend the lifetime of a context, so that the context does not get destroyed when the corresponding entity is no longer part of the list.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```js\n...\n  \n// Optional: First remove the keep-alive setting for the previous context of the detail view\noOldContext = oView.getBindingContext();\nif (oOldContext) {\n    oOldContext.setKeepAlive(false);\n}\n  \n// Share data between collection and view for a selected context, e.g. the second context\noNewContext = oTable.getItems()[1].getBindingContext();\noView.setBindingContext(oNewContext);\n  \n// Mandatory: Prevent destruction of the new context using the keep-alive setting\noNewContext.setKeepAlive(true, /*fnOnBeforeDestroy*/ function () {\n    // React destruction of a kept-alive context\n    var oDetail = oView.byId(\"detail\");\n \n    if (oDetail.getBindingContext() === oNewContext) {\n        oDetail.setVisible(false);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThe data of the kept-alive context shown in list and detail view will be in sync, even if the kept-alive context is not shown in the list and loaded again later.\n\nThe optional callback function `fnOnBeforeDestroy` is called when the kept-alive context is destroyed. This happens if:\n\n-   the list binding is relative and its context is changed,\n-   the list binding is destroyed,\n-   the context is deleted,\n-   due to a refresh, the entity is no longer accessible via its previous path.\n\nIf you want to get [server messages](server-messages-in-the-odata-v4-model-fbe1cb5.md) for the kept-alive context, but not for the list, use the `bRequestMessages` parameter. The messages for this context are requested immediately and with each subsequent refresh. You can then get the latest messages as a side effect via [`v4.Context#requestSideEffects`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/requestSideEffects).\n\nA \\(de-\\)selected context may be kept alive in order to preserve its selection state. For more information, see [Selection](selection-ec55312.md)and [`v4.Context#setSelected`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/setSelected).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio648e360fa22d46248ca783dc6eb44531__section_APBS\"/>\n\n## Absolute Property Bindings of Singletons\n\nIn general, absolute property bindings raise their own data requests. Hence, a separate request is created for each property, and duplicate requests may occur. For absolute property bindings of singletons, however, the requests are merged, and duplicate requests are avoided.\n\nThe following example shows absolute property bindings for a singleton and an entity which is not a singleton:\n\n**Absolute Property Bindings**\n\n```xml\n<FlexBox>\n    <Text text=\"{/Me/FirstName} {/Me/LastName}\"/>\n    <Button text=\"{/Me/FirstName}\">\n    <Text text=\"{/People('johndoe')/FirstName} {/People('johndoe')/LastName}\"/> \n    <Button text=\"{/People('johndoe')/FirstName}\">\n</FlexBox>\n```\n\nFor the singleton, the requests are merged:\n\n**Resulting Requests**\n\n```html\nrequests for absolutely bound singleton properties are merged, data is reused:\n \n  GET Me?$select=FirstName,LastName\n \nother absolutely bound properties are requested one by one:\n \n  GET People('johndoe')/FirstName\n  GET People('johndoe')/LastName\n  GET People('johndoe')/FirstName\n```\n\n",
