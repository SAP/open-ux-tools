Typically, these methods are not called directly in applications, but indirectly by the following:\n\n-   Binding an SAPUI5 control through an API such as `oForm.bindElement(\"{/SalesOrderList('0500000000')}\");`\n\n    This sample binds a form to a certain sales order so that form elements can be bound to display or change single properties of the sales order.\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > Note that binding expressions can be complex so that they can take additional properties to specify the binding further in addition to the path:\n    > \n    > ```js\n    > \n    > oForm.bindElement({path : \"/SalesOrderList('0500000000')\", parameters : {$expand : \"SO_2_SOITEM\", ...}, events : {dataReceived : '.onDataEvents', ...}});\n    > ```\n    > \n    > This allows you, for instance, to specify [OData V4 binding parameters](parameters-1ab4f62.md) such as `$expand` or attach to OData V4 [Binding Events](binding-events-1a010d3.md) such as `dataReceived`.\n\n    For a complete example, see the `onSalesOrderSelect` method \\(file: `Main.controller.js`\\) in the [SalesOrders sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.odata.v4.SalesOrders/preview) in the Demo Kit.\n\n-   Declaring a binding for a control property in an XML view such as the following:\n\n    ```xml\n    \n    <Table items=\"{path : '/SalesOrderList', parameters : { $expand : 'SO_2_BP', $filter : 'BuyerName ge \\'M\\'', ...}, events : {dataReceived : '.onDataEvents', ... } }\">\n    ```\n\n    For a complete example, see the `Main.view.xml` file in the [SalesOrders sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.odata.v4.SalesOrders/preview) in the Demo Kit.\n\n\n",
