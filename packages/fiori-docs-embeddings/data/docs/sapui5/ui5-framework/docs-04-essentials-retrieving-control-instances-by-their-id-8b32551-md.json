The controller is called `this` in the following examples.\n\n    -   When no fragment ID was given: `myControl = this.byId(\"myControl\")`\n\n    -   When a fragment ID `myFrag` was given: `myControl = this.byId(Fragment.createId(\"myFrag\", \"myControl\"))`, with `Fragment` required from module `sap/ui/core/Fragment`\n\n\n\n",
