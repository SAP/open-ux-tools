This attribute provides information about the current operating system and version. In case of mobile platforms, SAPUI5 also adds a platform-dependent CSS class to the HTML tag of the page. This enables control or application developers to create platform-dependent styling for their controls or applications.\n\n\n\n## Technical Details\n\nWhen the SAPUI5 bootstrap script file is loaded, a check is performed to see which platform the application is running on. The attribute and \\(in case of mobile platforms\\) the CSS class are added to the HTML tag.\n\n\n\n### Platform Attribute\n\nThe platform attribute value has the following connotation: **OS + version**, for example `iOS13.0` or `Android9.1.1`. **OS** can have the following values:\n\n-   `iOS` \\(iOS devices\\)\n-   `mac` \\(macOS devices\\)\n-   `Android` \\(Android devices\\)\n-   `win` \\(Windows devices\\)\n\nThe version numbers are separated by dots.\n\n\n\n### CSS Class\n\nThe possible values for the CSS class are:\n\n-   `sap-ios` \\(Apple devices\\)\n-   `sap-android` \\(Android devices\\)\n\n\n\n### Example\n\nThe platform attribute or CSS class is used as follows:\n\n-   To provide a different font on Android devices, you specify your font by directly using the CSS class `sap-android`.\n\n    ```\n    \n    .sap-android {\n    \t     font-family: Roboto;\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   Example for providing a different font when running on `Android 9.x`:\n\n    ```\n    \n    html[data-sap-ui-os^='Android9'].sap-android {\n    \tfont-family: \"Droid Sans\";\n    }\n    ```\n\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[API Reference: `sap.ui.Device.os.OS`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.Device.os.OS)\n\n",
