Due to the same-origin policy, browsers deny AJAX requests to service endpoints in case the service endpoint has a different domain/subdomain, protocol, or port than the app.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio5bb388fc289d44dca886c8fa25da466e__section_a3s_mvw_p1b\"/>\n\n## Preview\n\n  \n  \n**Violations of the same-origin policy in Google Chrome**\n\n![](../03_Get-Started/images/Tutorial_Walkthrough_Step_26_CORS_2c36d72.png \"Violations of the same-origin policy in Google Chrome\")\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio5bb388fc289d44dca886c8fa25da466e__section_q5w_mvw_p1b\"/>\n\n## Root Cause\n\nNormally, the remote system would be configured to send the cross-origin resource sharing \\(CORS\\) headers to make the browser also allow direct access to remote URLs. However, if you, for example, use a Northwind OData service, you cannot modify the publicly available service. Then when you try to execute XHR requests \\(`XMLHttpRequest`\\) the browser prevents the call due to the same-origin policy.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio5bb388fc289d44dca886c8fa25da466e__section_v4n_mvw_p1b\"/>\n\n## Resolution\n\nTo solve the issue, you have the following options:\n\n-   SAP Web IDE: Configure a destination as described below \\(recommended\\)\n\n-   Local Development: Configure a local proxy\n\n-   Workaround: Disable the same-origin policy in the browser for local testing \\(not recommended, only for testing\\)\n\n-   Set the CORS-relevant response headers on the remote system \\(if possible\\)\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio5bb388fc289d44dca886c8fa25da466e__UsingHelperService\"/>\n\n## SAP Business Application Studio: Configure a destination\n\nSAP Business Application Studio and SAP Business Technology Platform offer destinations that allow you to easily connect to remote systems. The destination to the Northwind OData service is an internet proxy made available inside the app. Any request that is sent to this location is forwarded to `https://services.odata.org` automatically.\n\n\n\n### Create Destination in SAP BTP Cockpit\n\nThe destination is configured inside the SAP BTP cockpit. For more information, see [Create a Destination in the SAP BTP cockpit](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-create-destination.html).\n\n\n\n### manifest.json\n\nIn the `manifest.json` descriptor file of your app, you can now change the data source to use the remote destination, for example:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"_version\": \"1.59.0\",\n  \"sap.app\": {\n\t...\n\t\"dataSources\": {\n\t  \"invoiceRemote\": {\n\t\t\"uri\": \"/V2/Northwind/Northwind.svc/\",\n\t\t\"type\": \"OData\",\n\t\t\"settings\": {\n\t\t  \"odataVersion\": \"2.0\"\n\t\t}\n\t  }\n\t}\n  },\n  \"sap.ui\": {\n\t...\n  },\n  \"sap.ui5\": {\n\t...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAfter this change, you can run the app in SAP Business Application Studio without disabling the same-origin policy of your browser. The destination now manages the connection to the remote service.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio5bb388fc289d44dca886c8fa25da466e__CORSAnywhere\"/>\n\n## Local Development: Configure a local proxy\n\n> ### Caution:  \n> Please note that any npm packages you install from third parties can not only modify your project but also execute arbitrary code on your system. Always act with the according care and follow best practices.\n\nA proxy is simply a service end point on the same domain of your app to overcome the restrictions. It receives requests from the app, forwards them to another server, and finally returns the corresponding response from the remote service.\n\nFollow the steps below to configure a proxy of your choice in your project. Make sure to replace the**`myProxy`** placeholder with your actual proxy name.\n\nPrerequisites: NodeJS is installed on your machine.\n\n\n\n### package.json\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"name\": \"Sample-Package\",\n\t\"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n\t\"description\": \"Sample package.json\",\n\t\"scripts\": {\n\t\t\"proxy\": \"node proxy.js\"\n\t},\n\t\"devDependencies\": {\n\t\t\"myProxy\": \"^x.y.z\"\n\t},\n\t\"dependencies\": {\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nAdd the `devDependency` called `\"myProxy\": \"^x.y.z\"` to your existing `package.json`. Run `node install` to install the npm module. Add the `proxy` script to the `scripts` section in the `package.json` so that you can run a script via `npm run <script_name>`.\n\n\n\n### proxy.js \\(new\\)\n\n```js\nvar cors_proxy = require('myProxy');\n\n// Listen on a specific IP Address\nvar host = 'localhost';\n\n// Listen on a specific port, adjust if necessary\nvar port = 8081;\n\ncors_proxy.createServer({\n\t// Set parameters for:\n\t// allowed origins,\n\t// required headers ['origin', 'x-requested-with'],\n\t// headers to be removed ['cookie', 'cookie2']\n}).listen(port, host, function() {\n\tconsole.log('Running myProxy on ' + host + ':' + port);\n});\n```\n\nCreate a new file `proxy.js`, and copy the above script into your project directory. This is the pre-configured proxy server we are going to use to prevent the occurrence of **same-origin policy error**. We can start it by running the command `node proxy.js` or `npm run proxy`. It runs a local proxy on `port` in the console.\n\n\n\n### manifest.json\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"sap.app\": {\n\t\t...\n\t\t\"dataSources\": {\n\t\t\t\"northwind\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"uri\": \"http://localhost:8081/https://services.odata.org/V2/Northwind/Northwind.svc/\",\n\n\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"OData\",\n\t\t\t\t\"settings\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"odataVersion\": \"2.0\"\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nTo use a service in the `local ui5 application` we have to change the `uri` in the `manifest` file.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The `uri` must start with `http://localhost:<port>`.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> By default, you can't run the request in your browser with the `proxy.js` script. It throws the following exception: `exception Missing required request header. Must specify one of: origin,x-requested-with`. If you want to test the service in your browser, you can temporarily comment out the parameter requiring the headers `['origin', 'x-requested-with']` from your `proxy.js`.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio5bb388fc289d44dca886c8fa25da466e__DisablingSameOriginPolicy\"/>\n\n## Workaround: Disable the same-origin policy in the browser \\(not recommended, only for testing\\)\n\nIn Google Chrome, you can easily disable the same-origin policy of Chrome by running Chrome with the following command: `[your-path-to-chrome-installation-dir]\\chrome.exe --disable-web-security --user-data-dir`. Make sure that all instances of Chrome are closed before you run the command. This allows all web sites to break out of the same-origin policy and connect to the remote service directly.\n\n> ### Caution:  \n> **This approach is not recommended for productive apps. Running Chrome this way for surfing on the internet poses a security risk.** However, it allows you to avoid the need of setting up a proxy at development time or for testing purposes.\n\n",
