The theme is provided as an additional theme in SAPUI5.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> This theme will have the status 'experimental' until testing is complete.\n\n<sub>New•Feature•Info Only•1.72</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-11-21\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.72 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nNew \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n****Responsive Paddings Enablement**** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n****Responsive Paddings Enablement****\n\nWe have introduced the `sap.ui.core.util.ResponsivePaddingsEnablement` utility for applying responsive paddings over separate parts of the controls, when using the SAP Quartz themes. The breakpoints and layout paddings can now be determined by the container's width, and not by the screen size. We have introduced responsive paddings to the `sap.m.Page`,`sap.m.Popover`, and `sap.m.Wizard` controls.\n\nFor more information, see [Enabling Responsive Paddings According to the Control Width](../04_Essentials/enabling-responsive-paddings-according-to-the-control-width-3b718b5.md).\n\n<sub>New•Feature•Info Only•1.72</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-11-21\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.72 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nNew \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.ProductSwitch` \\(Experimental\\)** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.f.ProductSwitch` \\(Experimental\\)**\n\nThe new layout control is a single-level navigation menu that offers access to the entry pages of products.

This additional information enables the routers in nested components to show the targets which are configured to one specific route.\n\nFor more information, see [`sap.ui.core.routing.Router.navTo`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.routing.Router/methods/navTo) in the API Reference and [Navigate with Nested Components](../04_Essentials/navigate-with-nested-components-8e9d6e4.md).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.72</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-11-21\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.72 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**\n\nThe new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:\n\n-   Server-driven paging is now supported unless the server-driven paging takes place in a collection requested with `$expand`.\n\n-   The `resetChanges` method on bindings returns a promise which is resolved without a defined result as soon as all changes in the binding itself and all dependent bindings are canceled.\n\n\n> ### Restriction:  \n> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing freestyle and SAP Fiori elements applications. Double-check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \\(such as tree binding\\). This also applies to smart controls \\(`sap.ui.comp` library\\) that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported in combination with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).\n\nFor more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.72</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-11-21\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.72 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Title Alignment Changes for SAP Quartz Themes** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Title Alignment Changes for SAP Quartz Themes**\n\nA new title alignment has been introduced for the SAP Quartz themes.
