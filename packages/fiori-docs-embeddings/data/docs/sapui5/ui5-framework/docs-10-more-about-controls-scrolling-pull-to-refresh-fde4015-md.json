You can provide a URL to a custom logo image with customIcon or switch display of logo of by setting showIcon to false. The first line of text \"Pull to refresh\" is standard and cannot be changed. However, you may set an optional description text to display, for example, the last update time.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> `PullToRefresh` control is part of the scroll area and therefore its height is reflected in the scroll bar calculation and display. The user can see that the page can be scrolled down to reveal the pull-down area.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiofde40159afce478eb488ee4d0f9ebb99__section_N10030_N10011_N10001\"/>\n\n## Carousel\n\nPull to Refresh does not work with a Carousel if both are contained in a page: in order to make Pull to Refresh work, the page has to enable scrolling which leads to problems with the Carousel \\(Carousel not visible\\). Suggested Workaround: Add a `sap.m.PullToRefresh` instance to each page that you add to your Carousel.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[API Reference: `sap.m.PullToRefresh`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.PullToRefresh)\n\n",
