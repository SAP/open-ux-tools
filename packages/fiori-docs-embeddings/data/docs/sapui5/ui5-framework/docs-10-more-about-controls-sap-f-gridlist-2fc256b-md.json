The grid serves as a framework in which you can organize controls in a consistent way throughout the design. Dividing a design space into a grid can help position individual elements in a visually appealing manner, facilitate the representation of a user flow, and make information more comprehensible and accessible.\n\nWith the new `sap.f.GridList`control, you can easily organize and align your content according to your preferences.\n\n  \n  \n**An example of a uniform grid layout, where all the grid items in a grout take the same dimensions**\n\n![](images/GridList_Diagram_1_91e4c6b.png \"An example of a uniform grid layout, where all the grid items in a grout take\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same dimensions\")\n\n  \n  \n**GridList allows for high flexibility layouts, where the app developer can decide on the specific placement and sizing of the grid items**\n\n![](images/GridList_Diagram_2_8b209b0.png \"GridList allows for high flexibility layouts, where the app developer can\n\t\t\t\t\tdecide on the specific placement and sizing of the grid items\")\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio2fc256be1b4649048b125320628e12f0__section_vmq_gw2_5fb\"/>\n\n## Layouts\n\n`sap.f.GridList` allows application developers to display list items in a two-dimensional grid where the visual layout/display options can be configured flexibly using predefined and custom templates. The layout used is based on the CSS display grid and has a default configuration that displays the list items in a grid.\n\n\n\n### `sap.ui.layout.GridBoxLayout`\n\n`sap.ui.layout.GridBoxLayout` is a layout that allows you to position controls in a grid, relative to one another, using constraints defined by its `boxWidth`, `boxMinWidh` or `boxesPerRowConfig` properties.\n\n-   `boxMinWidth` allows the items inside `sap.ui.layout.GridBoxLayout` to accommodate the available width without allowing them to be smaller than the specified `boxMinWidth`.\n\n-   `boxWidth` sets the exact width of the items inside `sap.ui.layout.GridBoxLayout` regardless of the remaining space available in the row.\n\n-   `boxesPerRowConfig` allows the alignment and specification of the number of items in a row, depending on the browser viewport size.\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> -   The height of all items is set to the height of the highest item.\n> \n> -   If the `boxWidth` property is set, `boxMinWidth` and `boxesPerRowConfig` properties are ignored. If the `boxMinWidth` property is set, `boxesPerRowConfig` property is ignored.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[API Reference: `sap.f.GridList`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.f.GridList)\n\n[Samples: `sap.f.GridList`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.f.GridList)\n\n",
