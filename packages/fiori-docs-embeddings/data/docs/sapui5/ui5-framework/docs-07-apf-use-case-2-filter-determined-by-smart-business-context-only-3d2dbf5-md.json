If the context contains a list of single values only, the value help lists all these values and by default, all values are selected. If the context contains other operators, an additional context resolution request is required. This request resolves the context into a list of single values. The value help then lists all these single values and by default, all values are selected.\n\nTo configure a filter for this use case, only the basic data for the filter is required. You don't have to enter information for the value help request.\n\nTo configure the context resolution request, enter the required information in the *Context Resolution* section.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If you did not specify a context resolution request, but a context resolution is necessary to be able to display the values in the value help, the filter for the corresponding property is not displayed on the UI. Instead, the context is applied to the analysis path in the background.\n\nThe options described above are depicted in the following figure:\n\n![](images/Facet_Filter_Configuration_Use_Case_2_c7a9ab2.png)\n\n",
