You configure the routing in the component’s manifest. Moreover, the target component can also come with its own routing, which integrates via enhanced configuration in the manifest.\n\nFor details, see [Enabling Routing in Nested Components](../04_Essentials/enabling-routing-in-nested-components-fb19f50.md).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.62</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-01-31\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.62 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nFeature \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**SAPUI5 OData V4 Model**\n\nThe new version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:\n\n-   Bound actions on collections can now be executed using the header context of the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding`. If the returned entity is part of the same entity set, the promise of `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#execute` can be resolved with a return value context.\n\n-   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#requestSideEffects` was introduced in SAPUI5 1.61 and now resolves side effects in :n navigations reloading only affected properties.\n\n-   The `##` syntax for branching into the `MetaModel` as described in `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#bindProperty` is now also available in property bindings.\n\n-   Non-primitive values are supported in property bindings with binding mode `OneTime` and target type `\"any\"`.\n\n-   The following methods can now be executed while a binding is suspended:\n\n    -   `filter`, `sort`, `changeParameters`, `setAggregation`, and `updateAnalyticalInfo` of `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding`\n\n    -   `changeParameters` of `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding`\n\n    -   `refresh` method of all bindings\n\n\n    When the binding is resumed, a request reflecting all the changes by these methods is triggered.\n\n\n> ### Restriction:  \n> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \\(such as tree binding\\). This also applies to smart controls \\(`sap.ui.comp` library\\) and SAP Fiori elements that do not support the SAPUI5 OData V4 model, as well as controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the SAPUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](../04_Essentials/changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).\n\nFor more information, see [OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/odata-v4-model-5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.62</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-01-31\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.62 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Carousel`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Carousel`**\n\nThe control can now display several items at once.

The `sap.m.CarouselLayout` defines how many items are displayed in the visible area of the `sap.m.Carousel` control and has a `visiblePagesCount` property, which determines the count of items to be displayed.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.Carousel) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.CarouselWithMorePages/preview).\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.62</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2019-01-31\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.62 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Column`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.Column`**\n\nThe `sortIndicator` property now shows a sort icon when a column is sorted.
