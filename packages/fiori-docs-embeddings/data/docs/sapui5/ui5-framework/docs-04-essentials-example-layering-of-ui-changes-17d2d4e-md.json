After the app was shipped to the customers, SAP changes *Vehicle* to *Automobile* in the original app.\n\nApplying the changes based on the layering concept, the customers would now get the following:\n\n-   In the app of customer 1, *Vehicle* would be replaced by *Automobile*. The *Info* field added by the customer would also be applied.\n\n-   In the app of customer 2, the change made by SAP \\(*Vehicle* renamed to *Automobile*\\) would not be applied. Reason: customer 2 renamed this field to *Car* and changes made by customers overrule changes made by SAP.\n\n\n",
