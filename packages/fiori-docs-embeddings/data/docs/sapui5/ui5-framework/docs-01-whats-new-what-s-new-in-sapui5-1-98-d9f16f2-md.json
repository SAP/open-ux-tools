For more information, see [Creating Entities](../04_Essentials/odata-v2-model-6c47b2b.md#loio4c4cd99af9b14e08bb72470cc7cabff4).\n\n-   You can now create inactive contexts using `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataListBinding#create`. There is no POST request for an inactive context. The context will become active as soon as any of its properties is changed. Once this happens, the `createActivate` event is raised, enabling the application to create a new inactive context.\n\n    Inactive contexts do not influence `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataListBinding#getCount`. They are neither pending changes nor are they reset by `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#resetChanges`. For more information, see [Creating Entities](../04_Essentials/odata-v2-model-6c47b2b.md#loio4c4cd99af9b14e08bb72470cc7cabff4).\n\n-   The `getAllCurrentContexts` method for list bindings returns all current contexts without raising a request.For more information, see [`sap.ui.model.ListBinding#getAllCurrentContexts`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.ListBinding%23methods/getAllCurrentContexts).\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.98</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-01-27\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.98 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nUI Changed \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nAnnouncement \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Chart Personalization Dialog Updated** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**Chart Personalization Dialog Updated**\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The following information concerns important changes for end users.

The sibling entity must be available as a :1 navigation property and is accessed with an operation binding. For more information, see [Draft Handling with the OData V4 Model](../04_Essentials/draft-handling-with-the-odata-v4-model-40986e6.md).\n\n-   An application can now create inactive contexts in a list binding using the `bInactive` parameter of `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#create`, provided the update group of the binding is an `Auto` group. There is no POST request for an inactive context. The context will become active as soon as any of its properties is changed. Once this happens, the `createActivate` event is raised, enabling the application to create a new inactive context.\n\n    Inactive contexts do not influence `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#getCount`. They are neither pending changes nor are they reset by `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#resetChanges` or `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#resetChanges`. For more information, see [Creating an Entity in a Collection](../04_Essentials/creating-an-entity-in-a-collection-c9723f8.md).\n\n-   The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#getAllCurrentContexts` method returns all current contexts without raising a request.\n\n-   The experimental `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#moveEntityTo` method introduced with SAPUI5 1.95 is deprecated.\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Feature•Info Only•1.98</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-01-27\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.98 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.DateTimePicker`, `sap.m.TimePicker`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.m.DateTimePicker`, `sap.m.TimePicker`**\n\nWe have introduced a shortcut button that focuses the current time.

This allows you to overwrite the backend sorting. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar%23annotations/PresentationVariant) and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfilterbar.PresentationVariantSortOrderAnnotation) for `SmartFilterBar`, the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField%23annotations/PresentationVariant), and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfield.PresentationVariantSortOrderAnnotation) for `SmartField`. \n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.98</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-01-27\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.98 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar`**\n\n-   Until now, `SmartFilterBar` was using `sap.m.DatePicker` for single date filters that use the `Edm.DateTime` OData type with the `sap:display-format=\"Date\"` annotation, and `Edm.String` OData type with the `sap:filter-restriction=\"single-value\"` annotation. Now, the control supports the new `sap.m.DynamicDateRange` control for single date filters. This allows you to store semantic dates and restore them later when navigating or selecting a variant.\n\n    In addition, we've adopted new single date options such as the first day of the current week, last day of the current week, first day of the current month, etc.\n\n-   `SmartFilterBar` now also supports the option to set a default operator for date range and single date controls. With this improvement, we’ve made it a lot easier to change the default operator in the XML view via control configuration. Note that this method is not applicable for operators that need a parameter, for example 'Next X Days' where X is the required parameter.\n\n    For more information, see the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar/sample/sap.ui.comp.sample.smartfilterbar.UseDateRangeType).\n\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.98</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-01-27\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.98 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.valuehelpdialog.ValueHelpDialog`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.comp.valuehelpdialog.ValueHelpDialog`**\n\nAfter introducing the visualization of multiple consecutive whitespace characters in the `SmartField` and `SmartFilterBar` controls in versions 1.96 and 1.97 respectively, we've now added this feature to the `ValueHelpDialog` control as well.\n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.98</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-01-27\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.98 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**\n\n-   We have introduced a new filter type – Search \\(experimental\\).

This allows card developers to map the values entered by the end user to the payload structure expected by the back-end service. For more information, see the [Action Handlers](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/configuration/actionHandlers) section and the [Sample](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/adaptive/adaptive-action-submit-custom-payload) in the Card Explorer.\n\n-   We have added support for more HTTP request methods. Together with GET and POST, Integration cards now also support PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, and HEAD methods. For more information, see the [Data Handling](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/data) section in the Card Explorer.\n\n-   Object cards are \\(experimentally\\) enhanced with new item types and a new attribute. The new item types are `NumericData`, which shows some KPIs, and `Status`. The new attribute is `maxLines` - it represents the maximum number of lines the text can take. For more information, see the [Object Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/object) section, the [To Do Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/todoCard) sample, and [Additional Object Details](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/additionalObjectDetails) sample in the Card Explorer.\n\n-   We have updated the `sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card` of type Adaptive with the new 1.01 version of UI5 Web Components. For more information, see the [Adaptive Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/adaptive) section in the Card Explorer.\n-   We have updated the `sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card` of type Adaptive to support the newest templating and markdown features available for Microsoft Adaptive Cards, by getting the latest versions of `adaptivecards-templating`, `adaptive-expressions`, and `markdown-it`. Due to changes in the templating syntax, developers should adapt their applications when they switch to version 1.98. For more information, see the [Adaptive Card](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/adaptive) section and the [Templating](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/adaptive/templating) and [Markdown](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/adaptive/markdown) Samples in the Card Explorer. \n\n<sub>Changed•Control•Info Only•1.98</sub>\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nInfo Only \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n2022-01-27\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n1.98 \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nChanged \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\nControl \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.richtexteditor.RichTextEditor`** \n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n**`sap.ui.richtexteditor.RichTextEditor`**\n\nWe have updated the TinyMCE version 5 used in `sap.ui.richtexteditor.RichTextEditor` to TinyMCE 5.10.2.
