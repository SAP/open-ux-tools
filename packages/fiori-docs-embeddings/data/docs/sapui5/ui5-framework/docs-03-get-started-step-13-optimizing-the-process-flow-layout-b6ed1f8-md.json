For example, there is too much space for the *Marketing* node and available space is not used. To optimize the position of the nodes, the `ProcessFlow` control provides the *optimizeLayout* API method. With this method, you can rearrange the nodes. Check it out and see the results:\n\n![](images/Final_Step11_2_b0f8d17.png)\n\nPlease keep in mind that this optimization has an influence on the app performance as rendering times will increase.\n\nFor more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.commons.ProcessFlow) in the Demo Kit.\n\n",
