To correctly integrate your app extension coding with SAP Fiori elements, use only the `extensionAPI` of SAP Fiori elements. For more information, see [Using the extensionAPI](using-the-extensionapi-bd2994b.md).\n> \n> After you've created an app extension, its display \\(for example, control placement and layout\\) and system behavior \\(for example, model and binding usage, busy handling\\) lies within the application's responsibility. SAP Fiori elements provides support only for the official `extensionAPI` functions. Don't access or manipulate controls, properties, models, or other internal objects created by the SAP Fiori elements framework.\n\nYou can either use [SAP Fiori tools](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_FIORI_tools/Latest/en-US), which is a set of extensions for SAP Business Application Studio and Visual Studio Code to create extensions, or you can create them manually.\n\nFor more information, see [Configure Page Elements](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/047507c86afa4e96bb3d284adb9f4726.html).\n\n> ### Note:  \n> We've removed videos showing step-by-step procedures using SAP Web IDE, which SAP no longer actively supports. You can still access the video using an older version of this document.\n\n**Related Information**  \n\n\n[Adding a Custom Message Strip to List Report and Analytical List Page](adding-a-custom-message-strip-to-list-report-analytical-list-page-and-object-page-tables-0fdbefb.md \"You can show your custom texts in the message strip above the table.\")\n\n",
