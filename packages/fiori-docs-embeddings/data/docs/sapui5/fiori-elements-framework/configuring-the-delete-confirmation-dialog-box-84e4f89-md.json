  `UI.HeaderInfo` annotation has both `Title` and `Description` defined\n\n        Flexible Column Layout mode: The i18n key to be used is `DELETE_WITH_OBJECTINFO`\n\n        Fullscreen mode: The i18n key to be used is `DELETE_WITH_OBJECTTITLE`\n\n    -   `UI.HeaderInfo` annotation has only `Title` defined:\n\n        The i18n key to be used is `DELETE_WITH_OBJECTTITLE`\n\n    -   `UI.HeaderInfo` annotation has neither `Title` nor `Description` defined:\n\n        The i18n key to be used is `ST_GENERIC_DELETE_SELECTED`.\n\n\n-   Sub Entity: These are applicable when a deletion is triggered from object page tables or the subobject.\n\n    -   `UI.HeaderInfo` annotation has both `Title` and `Description` defined\n\n        Flexible Column Layout mode: The i18n key to be used is `DELETE_SELECTED_ITEM_WITH_OBJECTINFO`\n\n        Fullscreen mode: The i18n key to be used is `DELETE_SELECTED_ITEM_WITH_OBJECTTITLE`\n\n    -   `UI.HeaderInfo` annotation has only `Title` defined\n\n        The i18n key to be used is `DELETE_SELECTED_ITEM_WITH_OBJECTTITLE`\n\n    -   `UI.HeaderInfo` annotation has neither `Title` nor `Description` defined:\n\n        The i18n key to be used is `DELETE_SELECTED_ITEM`\n\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio84e4f8967bf643c9b81d4d84cefdf367__section_uql_5yr_cnb\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4\n\nThe delete message for the main object \\(list report\\) does not yet consider the `UI.HeaderInfo` annotation. This is also true for a deletion from any table.\n\nThe applications can override the default text by the mechanism described in [Localization of UI Texts](localization-of-ui-texts-b8cb649.md) using the i18n keys mentioned below:\n\n-   Delete from List Report:\n\n    The generic delete confirmation message via the i18n key `C_TRANSACTION_HELPER_OBJECT_PAGE_CONFIRM_DELETE_WITH_OBJECTTITLE_SINGULAR` is displayed. This can be overridden by the applications.\n\n    ![](images/Message_for_Delet_in_List_Report_f70fafe.png)\n\n-   Delete from Object Page \\(or Subobject Page\\) Header:\n\n    The i18n key to be used is `C_TRANSACTION_HELPER_OBJECT_PAGE_CONFIRM_DELETE_WITH_OBJECTINFO`![](images/Message_for_Delete_from_Object_Page_Header_e7bb20c.png)\n\n    Only in this case is the `UI.HeaderInfo.Title` \\(**2915717** in the above screenshot\\) considered along with the `UI.HeaderInfo.Description` \\(**Standard Order** in the above screenshot\\).\n\n-   Delete from Object or Subobject Page Table:\n\n    The i18n key to be used is `C_TRANSACTION_HELPER_OBJECT_PAGE_CONFIRM_DELETE_WITH_OBJECTTITLE_SINGULAR`\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Applications that override the delete message when a single entry is being deleted from the table should revisit the `UI.HeaderInfo` annotation's configuration and adapt the texts accordingly.\n\n",
