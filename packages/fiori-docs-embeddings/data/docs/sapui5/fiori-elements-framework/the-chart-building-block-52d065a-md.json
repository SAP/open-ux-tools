For more information, see the [Enabling Aggregation in the Back End](configuring-charts-653ed0f.md#loio653ed0f4f0d743dbb33ace4f68886c4e__enabling_aggregation_subsection) subsection in [Configuring Charts](configuring-charts-653ed0f.md).\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> `Chart` Building Block\n> \n> ```\n> <macros:Chart\n>     id=\"chartDefault\"\n>     contextPath=\"/RootEntitySet\"\n>     metaPath=\"@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Chart\"\n>     dataPointsSelected=\".onChartSelectionChanged\"\n>     personalization=\"Sort,Type,Item\"\n>     selectionMode=\"Multiple\"\n> ></macros:Chart>\n> ```\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The `contextPath` is optional if `metaPath` is provided with an absolute path. If `metaPath` is relative and there is no `contextPath` given, then we consider the parent binding path as the value of `contextPath`.\n\nYou can do the following with the `Chart` building block:\n\n-   Link `Chart` building block with the `FilterBar` building block.\n\n-   Enable `Chart` building block for variant management.\n\n-   Add custom actions.\n\n-   Configure the chart title and control header visibility.\n\n-   Control the visibility of tabs within the chart personalization options.\n\n-   Get and set the presentation variants associated with the `Chart` building block using the public APIs: `getPresentationVariant()` and `setPresentationVariant()`.\n\n    Get and set the selection variants associated with the `Chart` building block using the public APIs: `getSelectionVariant()` and `setSelectionVariant()`. The `getSelectionVariant()` method considers only the variants that are applied directly to the table and excludes the variants that are applied to a bound model.\n\n    Check out our live example in the flexible programming model explorer at [Chart - Interacting via APIs](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/buildingBlocks/chart/chartPublicAPIs).\n\n    > ### Note:  \n    > The get and set selection variant methods only work if the chart personalization is enabled. For more information, see [Enabling Table Personalization](enabling-table-personalization-3e2b4d2.md).\n\n-   Get and set the currently visible variant ID.\n\n\nCheck out our live example in the flexible programming model explorer at [Chart Title](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/buildingBlocks/chart/chartDefault).\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Chart properties such as `headerVisible`, `header`, and `selectionMode` can be defined in both the `Chart` building block and `manifest.json` file. In such cases, the values in the `manifest.json` file take precedence over those in the `Chart` building block.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio52d065ab8bb740c58c834a0c985e3b9e__section_qqf_ljs_j5b\"/>\n\n## API\n\nFor information about the `Chart` API, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.fe.macros.Chart).\n\n",
