You can add a custom code to perform a refresh of specific data.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiof1c2704cc302401ba935f18e6303f123__section_tq2_jyk_jrb\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V2\n\nYou can use `onLeaveAppExtension` API to refresh the required data set as shown in sample below:\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ```\n> onLeaveAppExtension: function (bIsDestroyed) {\n> \tLog.info(\"onLeaveAppExtension called!\");\n> \tvar fnReactivate = function () {\n> \t\tsap.m.MessageToast(\"onLeaveAppExtension is called here\").show();\n> \t};\n> \treturn fnReactivate;\n> }\n> ```\n\nFor information about the `onLeaveAppExtension` API, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ObjectPage.controllerFrameworkExtensions). \n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiof1c2704cc302401ba935f18e6303f123__section_tpp_jzk_jrb\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4\n\nSAP Fiori elements provides two extension methods for applications that run in `sap-keep-alive` mode. Application developers can then add custom code when the application is suspended or restored during an external navigation.\n\n-   `onSuspend`: This extension API is called for all the visited pages when the app that runs in `sap-keep-alive` mode is suspended \\(that is, when an external navigation from such an application is triggered\\).\n\n-   `onRestore`: This extension API is called for all the visited pages when the app that runs in `sap-keep-alive` mode is restored \\(for example, when using the back navigation to such an application\\).\n\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> List report extension implementing `sap-keep-alive` extension APIs\n> \n> ```\n> return ControllerExtension.extend(\"SalesOrder.ext.LRExtend\", {\n>     // this section allows to extend lifecycle hooks or override public methods of the base controller\n>     override: {\n>         viewState: {\n>             onSuspend: function() {\n>                 // Applications can add their custom code here\n>             },\n>             onRestore: function() {\n>                 // Applications can add their custom code here\n>             }\n>         }\n>     }  \n> }\n> ```\n\n",
