Control-level variant management can also be used on the object page.\n\nUse control-level variant management to define separate variants for filters and table sections. The filter variant stores filter area selections and the filter mode. When you load the stored variant, both the filter area selection and filter mode appear. It is not possible to use control-level variant management and page-level variant management together.\n\nUse page-level variant management to capture filter selection, filter mode, view mode, auto-hide icon state \\(eye-icon\\), chart, and table configuration \\(measures and dimensions\\), sort order, and grouping. The page-level variant is enabled by default.\n\n![](images/Managing_Variants_df8f117.png)\n\n> ### Note:  \n> You can define variants for specific selections of data on the user interface, for example, based on filter settings. In the definition dialog, these variants are called views, however, the feature is called variant management. Therefore, for clarity, we use the term variant management in this section.\n\nYou can use either control-level variant management or page-level variant management for your list report and analytical list page. Providing both options simultaneously can confuse end users.\n\nFor more information about how to the enable control-level variant in the object page, see [Enabling Variant Management on the Object Page](enabling-variant-management-on-the-object-page-f26d42b.md).\n\n<a name=\"topic_fdm_n4r_1qb\"/>\n\n<!-- topic\\_fdm\\_n4r\\_1qb -->\n\n## Which Variant Is Loaded on Initial Load?\n\nFor table and chart control variants, SAP Fiori elements always loads the variant which end users have marked as their default variant.\n\nFor the filter control variant or the page variant, the following behavior applies:\n\n-   When the SAP Fiori elements application is launched through external navigation with a navigation context \\(either by using URL parameters or in `xAppState`\\), the incoming navigation context is applied, and the filter values of the end user's default variant are overridden. As a result, the variant displayed in the filterbar is *Standard\\** where \"\\*\" indicates that the variant is not in its clean state. However, the personalization settings for tables or charts from the end user's default variant are retained.\n\n-   SAP Fiori elements loads the end user's default variant \\(if configured\\) when navigation to the list report template is triggered with **no** navigation context. If no end user default variant is found, the standard variant is used as the fallback option. Only in this case does SAP Fiori elements apply the end user default values of FLP.\n\n\nFor more information, see [Loading Behavior of Data on Initial Launch of the Application](loading-behavior-of-data-on-initial-launch-of-the-application-9f4e119.md).\n\n<a name=\"topic_ctc_rlg_mqb\"/>\n\n<!-- topic\\_ctc\\_rlg\\_mqb -->\n\n## Managing Variants in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V2\n\nFor the list report, object page, and worklist, the `smartVariantManagement` variable is set to `true` by default within the `manifest.json` file. For the analytical list page, the `smartVariantManagement` variable is set to `false` by default. These settings are automatically set by the SAP Fiori generator. You can change the default settings in the `manifest.json` file, as shown in the following sample code:\n\n```js\n\"sap.ui.generic.app\": {\n        \"_version\":\"1.1.0\",\n        \"pages\": [You can change these default settings in the manifest.json file, as shown in the following sample code:\n            {\n                \"entitySet\": \"XXXXXX_Product\",\n                \"component\": {\n                    \"name\": \"sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ListReport\",\n                    \"list\": true,\n                    \"settings\" : {\n                        \"gridTable\" : false,\n                        \"multiSelect\": false,\n                        \"smartVariantManagement\": true\n```\n\nYou can also change the `smartVariantManagement` variable using the *Page Editor*. For more information, see [Configure Page Elements](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/047507c86afa4e96bb3d284adb9f4726.html).\n\nIf `smartVariantManagement` is set to `true`, the page-level variant is enabled. If it is set to `false`, control-level variant is enabled. If it is undefined, then the default setting is `true`.\n\nFor more information see, [Develop an Application](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/a9c004397af5461fbf765419fc1d606a.html).\n\n<a name=\"topic_jmz_ylg_mqb\"/>\n\n<!-- topic\\_jmz\\_ylg\\_mqb -->\n\n## Managing Variants in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4\n\nIn the `manifest.json` file, the `VariantManagement` variable is set to `Page` by default.
