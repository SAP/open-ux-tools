In most cases, the user has to either complete or delegate a work item.\n\nThe focus of the worklist floorplan is on processing the items. This differs from the list report floorplan, which focuses on filtering content to create a list.\n\n\n\n![](images/Image_Map_Worklist_b057362.jpg)\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiod1d588f1061b4bac96a1facb80d3f3a2__section_a25_1cx_nsb\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V2\n\nFrom a technical perspective, a worklist is a simplified list report. The following aspects differ from the list report features:\n\n-   You create a worklist using SAP Fiori application generator. In the*Template Selection* step, choose *Worklist Page* as a template. For more information, see [Building an App](building-an-app-9834a0a.md).\n\n-   The worklist does not contain a smart filter bar. The search field is available in the table toolbar.\n\n-   Variant management:\n    -   By default, variant management is hidden. You can customize the worklist to provide variant management at table level. To do so, set the `variantManagementHidden` flag to `false` in the `manifest.json` file. You can enable page level variant management by setting `smartVariantManagement` to `true` and the `variantManagementHidden` flag to `false` in the `manifest.json` file. Variants can also be shared.\n\n    -   The *Execute on Select* action is not available.\n\n\n-   Smart table:\n\n    -   The multiselect function is enabled for all tables. If there are only line item actions, a no-selection table is enabled.\n\n    -   The *Export to Microsoft Excel* feature is not available.\n\n    -   The default table type is **responsive**. The table title contains the row count. A fixed layout and scroll-to-load are the default settings for the table content.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Worklist Types\n\nYou can create a category worklist by defining multiple views within a table in your worklist. For more information, see [Defining Multiple Views on a List Report Table - Single Table Mode](defining-multiple-views-on-a-list-report-table-single-table-mode-0d390fe.md).\n\n\n\n### Configuring the Worklist\n\nFor more information about any worklist configuration options, see [List Report and Object Page](list-report-and-object-page-c0eec49.md). In addition to the features mentioned, you can also use the options described for the list report, for example:\n\n-   [Configuring List Report Features](configuring-list-report-features-3af1d03.md)\n\n-   [Configuring Navigation](configuring-navigation-a424275.md)\n\n-   [Configuring Tables](configuring-tables-f4eb70f.md)\n\n-   [Configuring Further Common Features](configuring-further-common-features-a4d3c46.md)\n\n-   [Extending List Reports and Object Pages Using App Extensions](extending-list-reports-and-object-pages-using-app-extensions-a892eb8.md)\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loiod1d588f1061b4bac96a1facb80d3f3a2__section_tqb_jcx_nsb\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4\n\nFrom a technical perspective, a worklist is a simplified list report without a filter bar. You can create a worklist template using the SAP Fiori application generator. For more information, see [Configuring Filter Bars](configuring-filter-bars-4bd7590.md).\n\n\n\nFor general information about the worklist floorplan, see [SAP Fiori Design Guidelines](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/).\n\n",
