You can adapt it by maintaining a text for this key in the app's i18n file.\n\nThe context displayed in the *Delete* dialog box is taken from the `Title` property of the `HeaderInfo` annotation. In the following sample code, the value mapped to the `\"so_id\"` property is shown in the dialog text.\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> XML Annotation\n> \n> ```xml\n> <Annotation Term=\"UI.HeaderInfo\">\n> <Record>\n>   <PropertyValue Property=\"TypeName\" String=\"Sales Order\"/>\n>      <PropertyValue Property=\"TypeNamePlural\" String=\"Sales Orders\"/>\n>      <PropertyValue Property=\"Title\">\n>        <Record Type=\"UI.DataField\">\n>          <PropertyValue Property=\"Value\" Path=\"so_id\"/>\n>        </Record>\n>      </PropertyValue>\n>    </Record>\n>  </Annotation>\n> \n> ```\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ABAP CDS Annotation\n> \n> ```\n> \n> @UI.headerInfo: {\n>   typeName: 'Sales Order',\n>   typeNamePlural: 'Sales Orders',\n>   title: {\n>     value: 'SO_ID',\n>     type: #STANDARD\n>   }\n> }\n> annotate view STTA_C_MP_PRODUCT with {\n> \n> }\n> \n> ```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio15b7740845b44b419a56eb63d34b8ab3__section_yfk_4ds_cnb\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4\n\nYou can override the keys that start with `C_TRANSACTION_HELPER_CONFIRM_DELETE` in the custom `i18n` file.
