It contains a header area and a footer area.\n\n\n\nEach card is bound to a single entity set in a data source, and its configuration is provided in the `\"sap.ovp\"...\"cards\"` object. The cards object contains the list of cards to display in the application.\n\nThe card ID is the property name, and the card configuration is provided as a value in the object. At runtime, the cards are displayed in the order that they appear in the application descriptor.\n\nFor more information on cards and its areas, see [Card](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/cards/).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio74332d5d829b413f9d7c0950dc6a71d2__section_nsk_34p_31b\"/>\n\n## Card Header\n\nAll cards have a static header section that can be configured in the descriptor configuration file. The card header includes the following properties: `category`, `title`, `subTitle` and card actions.\n\nThe `title` property is mandatory. The `subTitle` is only mandatory if the card contains data point annotations \\(such as a KPI header\\). The title and subtitle can contain a maximum of two lines. The header also contains a counter showing how many records are presented in the card out of the total existing records, according to the current filter.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> The counter is only displayed on table and list cards. For more information, see [Table Cards](table-cards-167bf7c.md) and [List Cards](list-cards-56f39e0.md).\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> manifest.json\n> \n> ```\n> \"sap.ovp\": {\n>     \"_version\": \"1.1.0\",\n>     \"globalFilterModel\": \"ZCD204_EPM_DEMO_SRV\",\n>     \"globalFilterEntityType\": \"SalesOrder\",\n>     \"cards\": {\n>         \"card00\": {\n>             \"model\": \"ZCD204_EPM_DEMO_SRV\",\n>             \"template\": \"sap.ovp.cards.stack\",\n>             \"settings\": {\n>                 ...\n>                 \"category\": \"{{card00_category}}\",\n>                 \"title\": \"{{card00_title}}\",\n>                 \"subTitle \": \"{{card00_subTitle}}\",\n>                 ...\n>             }\n>         },\n>         \"card01\": {\n>             \"model\": \"ZCD204_EPM_DEMO_SRV\",\n>             \"template\": \"sap.ovp.cards.table\",\n>             \"settings\": {\n>                 \"title\": \"{{card01_category}}\",\n>                 ...\n>             }\n>         },\n>         ...\n>     }\n> }\n> ```\n\n\n\n### **KPI Headers**\n\nThe generic card provides a dynamic section that can display a key performance indicator \\(KPI\\) and related information in the header. The KPI is an aggregated value, as defined in the annotation file. To display a KPI header in a card, make sure that your OData service supports aggregation of values and the data is coming from the backend only. The KPI header can contain a KPI value, including its unit of measure, its trend, percentage of change, and KPI header description.\n\nThe KPI extension uses the following annotation terms:\n\n-   `com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.DataPoint`: Used to retrieve information about the title and the value of the KPI.\n-   `com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.PresentationVariant`: Used to retrieve information about the fields which are used for grouping and sorting information.\n-   `com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.SelectionVariant`: Used to retrieve information about the filters.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> For more information about these annotations, see [Annotations Used in Overview Pages](annotations-used-in-overview-pages-65731e6.md).\n\nThese annotation terms can be configured in the application manifest file, as shown in the following example:\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ```\n> \n> \"sap.ovp\": {\n>     ...\n>     \"cards\": {\n>         ...\n>         \"card02\": {\n>             \"model\": \"ZCD204_EPM_DEMO_SRV\",\n>             \"template\": \"sap.ovp.cards.charts.bubble\",\n>             \"settings\": {\n>                 \"entitySet\": \"SalesOrders\",\n>                 \"identificationAnnotationPath\": \"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Identification#bubble\",\n>                 \"selectionAnnotationPath\": \"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.SelectionVariant#bubble\",\n>                 \"chartAnnotationPath\": \"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Chart#bubble\",\n>                 \"presentationAnnotationPath\": \"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.PresentationVariant#bubble\",\n>                 \"dataPointAnnotationPath\": \"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.DataPoint#bubble\"\n>             }\n>         },\n>         ...\n>     }\n> }\n> \n> ```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio74332d5d829b413f9d7c0950dc6a71d2__section_bd1_gyx_5wb\"/>\n\n## Card Actions\n\nCard actions are available as of SAPUI5 1.110. You can access and perform the card actions from the card header. The following card actions are available:\n\n-   *Refresh*: this action retrieves the entity bound to the card and reloads the card, displaying the latest data.\n\n-   *Add Card to Insights*: this action shows a preview of the card so that it can be added to the *Insights* section directly from the overview. Note that this action is only available if the *Insights* service is enabled.\n\n-   *Manage Cards*: this action opens the *Manage Cards* dialog where you can hide or show the available cards.\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio74332d5d829b413f9d7c0950dc6a71d2__section_qhh_dkw_z5b\"/>\n\n## Cards in *Insights*\n\nYou can add and use the analytical, list and table cards within the *Insights* section of **My Home** in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. The objective of displaying cards on the entry page is to visualize charts, KPIÂ´s and counters in the form of insights cards.\n\nTo add a card to the *Insights* section, select the *More* option from the card and choose *Add Card to Insights*. In the subsequent dialog box, you can update the card's *Title* and the *Subtitle*. Click *Add* to display the card in the *Insights* section.\n\nNote that only eight cards at a time can be displayed in the *Insights* section. If the maximum number of cards is already displayed on the entry page, the selected card is added to the *Edit Insights* dialog box. You can choose to select or deselect cards by editing the *Insights* section. For more information, see [**My Home** in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/4fc8d03390c342da8a60f8ee387bca1a/8a60279e8d2041b5ad8d3455fab0f3ef.html).\n\n\n\n### Disabling Card Generation\n\nAn application can also restrict the generation of individual analytical, list, and table cards. To do this, you can configure the card manifest setting by turning `enableAddToInsights` to `false`. This removes the option to add cards to the *Insights* section.\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ```\n> \"card01\": {\n>         \"model\": \"MODEL\",\n>         \"template\": \"sap.ovp.cards.charts.analytical\",\n>         \"settings\": {\n>           \"title\": \"{{card01_title}}\",\n>           \"subTitle\": \"{{card01_subTitle}}\",\n>           \"entitySet\": \"C_EntitySet\",\n>           \"enableAddToInsights\": false,\n>           \"selectionAnnotationPath\": \"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.SelectionVariant#SV\",\n>           \"chartAnnotationPath\": \"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Chart#Chart\",\n>           \"presentationAnnotationPath\": \"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.PresentationVariant#PV\",\n>           \"dataPointAnnotationPath\": \"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.DataPoint#DP\",\n>           \"identificationAnnotationPath\": \"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Identification\"\n>         }\n>       },\n> ```\n\n> ### Note:  \n> If custom navigation is enabled for a card, navigation from the *Insights* section of **My Home** for that card leads to the parent overview page application instead of the target maintained in the overview page card.\n\n",
