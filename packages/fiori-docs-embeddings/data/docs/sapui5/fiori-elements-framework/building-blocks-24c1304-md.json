These building blocks are not SAPUI5 controls, but rather a set of templating instructions that result in the creation of a specific control tree, depending on the bound data structures.\n\nInvoking the `Field` building block for a string property and a date property, for example, applies the following different transformations:\n\nUsage of the `Field` building block in a custom section\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ```\n> <macros:Field xmlns:macro=\"sap.fe.macros\" metaPath=\"MyStringProperty\" readOnly=\"true\"/>\n> <macros:Field xmlns:macro=\"sap.fe.macros\" metaPath=\"MyDateProperty\" readOnly=\"true\"/>\n> ```\n\nResult\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> ```\n> <m:Text xmlns:m=\"sap.m\" value=\"{MyStringProperty}\"/>\n> <m:DatePicker xmlns:m=\"sap.m\" value=\"{MyDateProperty}\"/>\n> ```\n\nThe building blocks provide a unified interface that creates an abstraction from the underlying implementation. As such, they also do not exist at runtime, except for a dedicated API object that allows you to manipulate the controls that were created through a restricted set of APIs. Building blocks are like templates: depending on the bound data and the specified attributes, they result in different controls for representing your data.\n\n> ### Remember:  \n> If you use building blocks within fragments that loads dynamically, ensure that the fragment loads using the `sap.fe.core.ExtensionAPI` method `loadFragment`.\n\nFor more information about building blocks as part of the flexible programming model, see [Flexible Programming Model](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/overview/introduction).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio24c1304739dd4f19af0ce2482c4d9bbe__section_gwt_f4f_4cc\"/>\n\n## Related Information\n\nFor more information about the `loadFragment` method, see [EditFlow](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.fe.core.ExtensionAPI%23overview) in the Demo Kit.\n\n",
