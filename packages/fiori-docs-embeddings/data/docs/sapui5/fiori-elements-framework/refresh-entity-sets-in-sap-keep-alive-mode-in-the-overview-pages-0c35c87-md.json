Application developers can configure which entity sets to refresh by defining specific settings in the `manifest.json` file.\n\nIn the following sample code, the entity set `self` is automatically refreshed when end users return to the source application:\n\n> ### Sample Code:  \n> `EntitySetName`: `self`\n> \n> ```\n> \"sap.ovp\": {\n>         \"globalFilterModel\": \"salesOrder\",\n>         \"globalFilterEntityType\": \"GlobalFilters\",//Represents the entity used as a global filter in the smart filter bar control. Deprecated since SAPUI5 1.54.\n>         \"globalFilterEntitySet\": \"ZFilterEntitySet\", //Represents the entity set used as a global filter in the smart filter bar control. Available from SAPUI5 1.54 onwards.\n>         \"smartVariantRequired\": true,\n>         \"enableLiveFilter\": true,\n>         \"containerLayout\": \"resizable\",\n>         ...\n>         \"refreshStrategyOnAppRestore\": {\n>             \"entitySets\": {\n>                 \"<entitySetToRefresh>\": \"self\"\n>             }\n>         },\n>         ...\n>         \"cards\": {\n>             ...\n>         }\n> }\n> ```\n\n",
