This mechanism enables a smooth user experience when navigating back and forth between apps developed using SAP Fiori elements and other apps.\n\nThe state of the application is preserved when users refresh or navigate away from an application created using SAP Fiori elements \\(either a list report or an object page\\) and then navigate back to this page. The application state is also preserved when the URL of the application is shared with another user who then opens the link. For more information, see [The Share Functionality](the-share-functionality-022bf0d.md).\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio46bf248182ed47cb85a05610abe361f7__section_nkf_5ff_ymb\"/>\n\n## What Is Stored/Restored\n\n-   Any filter field values in the list report filter bar. The *Go* button state, when available, is also considered.\n\n-   Any change in a chosen variant.\n\n    In SAP Fiori elements for OData V2, the chosen variant is always restored if it was stored in a 'clean' state. If the variant was marked as 'dirty', restoring leads to the loading of a *Standard* variant with a 'dirty' indicator.\n\n    In SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, the chosen variant is always restored and the fallback to the *Standard* variant only happens when the chosen variant isn't available at the time of the restore.\n\n-   Object page details such as tab selection, personalization of chart/table. For more information about object page handling, see [Enabling Discovery/Persistence Mode](enabling-discovery-persistence-mode-7c62084.md).\n\n-   Data from custom UI elements. For more information, see [Custom State Handling for Extended Apps](custom-state-handling-for-extended-apps-89fa878.md).\n\n\n> ### Note:  \n> -   If a potentially sensitive field \\(a property that is annotated using the `PersonalData.v1.IsPotentiallySensitive` annotation\\) is changed, SAP Fiori elements doesn't store/restore this information. Any changes added by users are therefore lost upon refresh. This is not applicable if the field is used in filter context. For more security-related information, see [Security Configuration](security-configuration-ba0484b.md).\n> \n> -   In SAP Fiori elements for OData V2, changes to the visibility of filter fields in the filter bar aren't stored/restored. However, if any new filter fields containing values are added from the *Adapt Filters* dialog, then they're stored as a part of the `iAppState`. The order of the filter fields in the smart filter fields is not stored or restored from the `iAppState`.\n> \n> -   Selections in a chart and a table, as well as the scroll position in a table, are not stored/restored.\n> \n> -   Refreshing the browser doesn't restore the `iAppState` if SAP Fiori launchpad isn't configured to persist it in the back end.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"loio46bf248182ed47cb85a05610abe361f7__section_bkt_vyl_mtb\"/>\n\n## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4\n\nNote the following restrictions related to the content provided in the [What Is Stored/Restored](store-restore-the-application-state-46bf248.md#loio46bf248182ed47cb85a05610abe361f7__section_nkf_5ff_ymb) section in this topic:\n\n> ### Restriction:  \n> -   Drilldown filters applied to the chart using the *View By* options aren't stored/restored.\n\n\n\n### Handling Changes from Other Layers\n\nChanges coming in from other flex layers, such as changes made by key users, are merged with user personalization changes coming from the `iAppState`. For more information, see [SAPUI5 Flexibility: Adapting UIs Made Easy](../04_Essentials/sapui5-flexibility-adapting-uis-made-easy-a8e55aa.md).\n\nChanges coming in from other flex layers are not considered in the following scenarios:\n\n-   When navigating from dynamic tiles created by the user using the *Save as Tile* option.\n\n-   When navigating from integration cards, as the user's intention is to return to the same application state as when the card was created.\n\n\n> ### Restriction:  \n> In the preceding scenarios, the following changes by the end user aren't retained or restored while navigating back to SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 application:\n> \n> -   The filter fields or table columns that were removed\n> \n> -   Changes in the position of the filter fields or table columns\n\n> ### Note:  \n> Restoring a shared URL reinstates the last state of the control if variant management isn't enabled. For example, consider the following scenario:\n> \n> -   A key user adds two columns to a table in a list report-based application.\n> \n> -   User A loads the application and adds two new columns. To share the application link as an email to user B, user A clicks the *Share* menu button and then *Send Email*.\n> \n> -   When user B accesses this application, they see the table with the changes made by user A. It means user B sees the last state of the table and not the state as seen by the key user.\n\n> ### Note:  \n> -   Any filter field value coming from other layers is still overwritten by values for this field coming from SAP Fiori launchpad. For more information, see [Configuring Default Filter Values](configuring-default-filter-values-f27ad7b.md).\n> \n> -   The logic that allows changes from other layers to be merged by the flex layer with the changes coming from an end user is only applied if the variant within the `iAppState` is available at the time when the restore takes place. If this is not the case, for example, when the page was shared to another user and the target user doesn't have access to the variant shared in the `iAppState`, then the app loads using the *Standard* variant, and the full state of the page when it is shared is applied on top, meaning without any other layer changes. When this happens, the following changes won't be retained:\n> \n>     -   The filter fields or table columns that were removed\n>     -   Changes in the filter field or table column position\n> \n> -   For a single-valued field, the merge logic always has priority over the other layer value \\(the value of the key user, for example\\), and the changes made by the end user for the same field are ignored.\n\n",
