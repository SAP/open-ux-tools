# Test Fixtures

The analyser will require representative SAP Fiori applications to validate the bill of materials extraction logic. Planned fixtures include:

- **V4 List Report Object Page** generated via the existing project generators, trimmed to the minimal manifest and annotation assets required to exercise the collectors.
- **Customised scenarios** covering bespoke filter bars, custom table columns, and object page custom sections with building blocks.

All fixtures should avoid sensitive data and keep file sizes small to ensure fast unit test execution.
