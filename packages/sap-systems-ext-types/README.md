# Connection Manager for SAP Systems (types)

This module contains shared type definitions for the **Connection Manager for SAP Systems** extension. These types are consumed by `sap-ux-sap-systems-ext` and `@sap-ux/sap-systems-ext-webapp`.


### Developer Note
When making changes to this module, you are also required to add `sap-ux-sap-systems-ext` to the changeset in order for the extension to be released with the changes. This is due to the fact that this package is private and therefore excluded from the changesets release workflow.
